This is a timeline of events that occurred in 2011.

==2011==
*[[Jim Pruitt]] retires from military service after 10 years. He would eventually join [[Anvil]].<ref>''[[Virtue of the Vicious|The Punisher: 1.10: Virtue of the Vicious]]''</ref>

*British television series ''{{WPS|Downton Abbey}}'' begins to air in the [[United States of America]], becoming one of [[Happy Hogan]]'s favorite shows.<ref name="IM3">''[[Iron Man 3]]''</ref>

====11th====
*[[Ghost]] goes on a mission through a forest to steal something for [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]].<ref>In ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]'', several moments are shown from Ava Starr's past at S.H.I.E.L.D.. Hannah John-Kamen was 28.05 at the middle of filming and should not be playing Starr at an age any younger than ⅔ of her actual age, so 18.70, meaning, based on Starr's approximated date of birth (see [[1980s]] references), that the scenes should be after April 26, 2007. One moment appears to say [https://i2.wp.com/caps.pictures/201/7-antman-wasp/full/antman-wasp-movie-screencaps.com-5634.jpg?strip=all "01-8 Thu"], suggesting it is Thursday, January 8, 2009. Evenly distributing between these two dates, the first set of scenes should be approximately September 29, 2007, March 4, 2008, and August 7, 2008, before then January 8, 2009. Then after that, the remaining scenes are between then and the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D. on January 12, 2014 (see [[2014]] references). Evenly distributing again, the remaining scenes should be January 9, 2010, January 11, 2011, January 12, 2012, and January 12, 2013.</ref><ref>''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]''</ref>

He is attacked by local bandits and turns into the [[Hulk]].<ref name="TA More Than a Year">In ''[[The Avengers]]'', on May 2, 2012, Natasha says, "You've been more than a year without an incident." This fits with Bruce's British Columbia incident being July 2010, and then "more than a year" back from May 2, 2012 would imply around 13½ months, roughly March 18, 2011.</ref><ref name="TATAI">''[[The Avengers: The Avengers Initiative]]''</ref><ref name="TA">''[[The Avengers]]''</ref>

*Learning that the defeat of [[Loki]] could potentially put the [[Nine Realms]] in peril, [[Thor]] warns [[Hogun]] that his people in [[Vanaheim]] are in danger of attack from [[Marauders]].<ref name="TTDW Prelude 2011 Placement">The beginning of ''[[Thor: The Dark World Prelude]]'' picks up a while after the end of ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'', with the universe still shifting as the inhabitants of numerous realms realize that the Bifrost is gone. It then goes to "one year later", to the beginning of ''The Avengers''.  With it seeming like it has not been more than several months since the Duel at the Bifrost Bridge, together with the fact that it is a year before April 30, 2012, this places the opening of the comic around April 14, 2011.</ref><ref name="TTDWP">''[[Thor: The Dark World Prelude]]''</ref>

[[File:PepperIM3P.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Pepper Potts]] announcing the construction of [[Stark Tower]]]]
*[[Pepper Potts]] gives an interview on [[Stark Tower]].<ref name="IM3P Months">In ''[[Iron Man 3 Prelude]]'', it is shown as beginning a while after ''[[Iron Man 2]]'', with the damage from the Expo having been cleared up and Stark Tower having been fully planned, laid its foundations, and several levels into its construction. It then jumps to 2 months later, Mumbai, then 3 months later, Afghanistan, then 2 months later, Sudan, then 3 months later, Hong Kong, and this is shown to be the date of the Battle of New York, May 4, 2012. 3 months back from there would put Sudan around February 2012, 2 months further back would put Afghanistan around December 2011, 3 months further back puts Mumbai around September 2011, and a final 2 months back places the beginning in July 2011. This allows plenty of time, just over a year, for the Expo to be cleared completely and for the planning, foundations, and beginning of construction of Stark Tower. Several months prior to the beginning of the comic, work would have begun on the tower, around December 2011.</ref><ref name="IM3P">''[[Iron Man 3 Prelude]]''</ref>

====11th====
*[[Tony Stark]] and [[Pepper Potts]] have a romantic dinner in [[Tony Stark's Mansion]] where she gives him a set of magnets that can keep magnetic power permanently and were made in [[Japan]].<ref name="TAIMMVII 2011 Placement">The ending of ''[[The Avengers: Iron Man Mark VII]]'' is set a while after the end of ''[[Iron Man 2]]'', a little while before ''[[The Avengers]]'', as it is just as Stark begins work on the new idea for his Mark VII suit. It can be assumed that it is about two thirds of the way between the last we see of Stark on June 2, 2010 and the first we see of him in ''The Avengers'' on May 2, 2012, so around September 11 and 12, 2011.</ref><ref name="TAIMMVII">''[[The Avengers: Iron Man Mark VII]]''</ref>

[[File:Valkyrie frozen.jpg|thumb|250px|The ''[[Valkyrie (Vehicle)|Valkyrie]]'' is found]]
*In the [[Arctic]], a Russian oil team discovers the crashed ''[[Valkyrie (Vehicle)|Valkyrie]]''. Eighteen hours later, [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents are dispatched to the area, and exploring the wreckage they find the body of [[Steve Rogers]], who is still alive and cryogenically preserved in the ice.<ref name="CATFA 2011 Placement">The timeline placement for the modern day placement of ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'' comes from reasoning out the evidence to find what fits best.
<br>In ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'', it is said that Steve has been asleep for "almost 70 years". In ''[[The Avengers]]'', Steve says, "I slept for 70 years." The 70 can easily be simply interpreted as a rounded decade, and this is corroborated by what he says in ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'', "slept for 65 years." This is more specific than the 70, so overall it seems that the suggestion is that he slept for around 66¾ years. With him going into the ice in March 4, 1945, this would imply that he woke around December 2011. In the ''Fury's Big Week'' comic, it is shown that Steve was found "one year later" after Day 7 of Fury's Big Week, which is June 4, 2010. This would imply that he woke around June 2011. The general, approximate real time setting of the ''[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]'' would suggest that he woke around July 2011. In ''The Avengers'', when Steve is brought into the mission on May 2, 2012, it seems he has been awake only a few months, implying that he woke around late 2011-early 2012.
<br>The best solution possible, to satisfy the most evidence with the most importance possible, is reasoned out as the modern day events of ''Captain America: The First Avenger'' being set from October 5-8, 2011.

====21st====
*After 22 months in [[Sokovia]]n prison, [[Mary Walker]] has a third alter personality of hers, which she had not been aware of, triggered. The third alter is vicious, ruthless, and bloody, tearing through her captors and escaping, leaving a bloodbath in her wake.<ref name="IF2 Mary Imprisonment">In ''[[A Duel of Iron]]'', Walker says she was freed after "22 months". On [https://marvel.propstoreauction.com/m/lot-details/index/catalog/198/lot/43094/?url=%2Fm%2Fview-auctions%2Fcatalog%2Fid%2F198%2F%3Fpage%3D8%26items%3D96 Marvel Television Live Auction Lot #886: Mary Walker's Classified Papers], it says Walker "served 8 years in various locals" before being "captured and held in isolation". Taking Alice Eve's age at the time of filming and working back from the setting, Mary Walker would have been born around September 1981. Given that she then could have joined the army no earlier than September 1998, the earliest she could have been kidnapped then would be January 1, 2006 (and calling it "8 years" in the general sense of "2006 - 1998 = 8") making the middle of her imprisonment roughly early December 2006 at the earliest. In ''[[Citadel on the Edge of Vengeance]]'', it is said that Walker's escape was "years ago", making it roughly late 2015 at the latest, so the middle of her imprisonment roughly January 2015 at the latest. Using the mid-point of this window to approximate, the middle of her imprisonment can therefore be calculated to be roughly December 21, 2010, making her imprisonment roughly January 21, 2010-November 21, 2011. The specifics of the calculation can be found [[User:Marvelus/Netflix (2017-) Shows Timeline#2011|here]].</ref><ref>''[[A Duel of Iron|Iron Fist: 2.10: A Duel of Iron]]''</ref>
[[File:Bloody Mess in Sokovia.png|thumb|250px|Walker after making her way out of the [[Sokovia]]n prison]]
*Mary Walker is found, with her Mary personality back at the fore, as [[United States Armed Forces]] close in on her location after hearing reports of the carnage. She is clueless as to how she escaped, not retaining the memories of her other alters, and assumes her Walker alter got her out. However, Walker would go on to assume that, since she, too, was not involved in their escape, Mary must have convinced someone to get them out.<ref name="IF2 Mary Imprisonment"/><ref>''[[Citadel on the Edge of Vengeance|Iron Fist: 2.08: Citadel on the Edge of Vengeance]]''</ref>
