They look the same age as in 2017, so it can be assumed to be not long before the present events. Poindexter is a special agent at the FBI, so his work at the hotline can be taken to have ended at least 4 years prior. It is presumably not much longer ago than that, however, given their appearances. It is seemingly some time into his time working there, since he has become fixated on Barnes, but not too long given the way she encourages him and how he comes across. It can be assumed, therefore, to be approximately in the middle of his \"1 [year]\" (stated in <i>The Perfect Game</i>) there. Being a special agent by October 23, 2017 (see [[2017]] references), the scene can therefore be placed about 4.5 years prior, around April 23, 2013.",
