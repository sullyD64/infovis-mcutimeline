This is a timeline of events that occurred in 2010.

==2010==
===January===
====6th====
*[[Nick Fury]] sends in a team of [[United States Navy SEALs]] to board a ship controlled by the [[Ten Rings]] in the port of [[Aden]]. However, [[Iron Man]] suddenly appears and attacks the terrorists killing them and saving the SEALs.<ref name="IM Comics Between Films">There are several comics set in the months between ''[[Iron Man (film)|Iron Man]]'' and ''[[Iron Man 2]]''.<br>''[[Iron Man 2: Phil Coulson: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' is shown to be set on the day of "I am Iron Man", November 25, 2009.<br>''[[Iron Man 2: Black Widow: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' is shown to be set in the several days preceding her first meeting Tony Stark in ''Iron Man 2'', during May 2010 (May 12-21, 2010).<br>The [[:File:Marvel-Movie-Universe.jpeg|2012 official ''MCU'' timeline]] places Tony Stark talking to Thaddeus Ross in ''[[Iron Man 2: Public Identity]]'' "3 months" after "I am Iron Man" on November 25, 2009. This can be taken as specifically around February 25, 2010, or more generally as "February 2010 - November 2009 = 3 months", meaning any point in February 2010, approximately February 14-15, 2010. Overall, it can be calculated, putting more weight on the specifics, that that is most likely February 22, 2010. This places the comic as February 17-23, 2010.<br>The final official canon comic in this time period is ''[[Iron Man 2: Nick Fury: Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''. It is set in the period between ''Iron Man''/''Iron Man 2: Phil Coulson: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' and ''Iron Man 2''/''Iron Man 2: Black Widow: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'', and was released before ''Iron Man 2: Public Identity'', so should be set between ''Iron Man''/''Iron Man 2: Phil Coulson: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' and ''Iron Man 2: Public Identity'', between November 25, 2009 and February 17, 2010, therefore approximately January 6, 2010.<br>Next, there are "inspired canon" comics to be placed, using the already-established canon comics as markers to place them between due to the fact that by their nature, they should be extricable from canon and therefore not affect the placements of official canon instalments.<br>''[[Iron Man 2: Security Breach]]'' is set in the period between ''Iron Man'' movies and was released before ''Iron Man 2: Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'', so should be set between ''Iron Man''/''Iron Man 2: Phil Coulson: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' and ''Iron Man 2: Nick Fury: Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.'', between November 25, 2009 and January 6, 2010, therefore approximately December 16, 2009.<br>''[[Iron Man: Limited Edition]]'' was released after ''Iron Man 2: Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' and before ''Iron Man 2: Public Identity'', so should be set in that period, between January 6, 2010 and February 17, 2010, therefore approximately January 27, 2010.<br>''[[Iron Man Royal Purple Custom Comic]]'' and ''[[Iron Man 2: Fist of Iron]]'' are set in the period between ''Iron Man'' movies and was released after ''Iron Man 2: Public Identity'', so should be set between ''Iron Man 2: Public Identity'' and ''Iron Man 2''/''Iron Man 2: Black Widow: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'', between February 23, 2010 and May 7, 2010, therefore approximately March 20, 2010 and April 13, 2010 respectively.<br>Finally, there is ''[[Iron Man: Will Online Evils Prevail?]]'' to be placed, using the already-established comics as markers to place it between due to the fact that it has information contradicting canon so is likely fully non-canon and thus should be further extricable from the timeline. It was released after ''Iron Man 2: Security Breach'' and before ''Iron Man 2: Nick Fury: Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.'', so should be set in that period, between December 16, 2009 and January 6, 2010. This would give approximately December 25-28, 2009, but to avoid Christmas, it can be placed slightly later - December 27-30, 2009.<br>Overall, this gives:
*November 25, 2009 - ''Iron Man 2: Phil Coulson: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.''
*December 16, 2009 - ''Iron Man 2: Security Breach''
*December 27-30, 2009 - ''Iron Man: Will Online Evils Prevail?''
*January 6, 2010 - ''Iron Man 2: Nick Fury: Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.''
*January 27, 2010 - ''Iron Man: Limited Edition''
*February 17-23, 2010 - ''Iron Man 2: Public Identity''
*March 20, 2010 - ''Iron Man Royal Purple Custom Comic''
*April 13, 2010 - ''Iron Man 2: Fist of Iron''

*[[Iron Man]] returns to his [[Tony Stark's Mansion|mansion]] and informs [[Pepper Potts]] about the recent events.<ref name="IM Comics Between Films"/><ref name="IM2NFDoS"/>

====9th====
*[[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] monitors track [[Ghost]].<ref>In ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]'', several moments are shown from Ava Starr's past at S.H.I.E.L.D.. Hannah John-Kamen was 28.05 at the middle of filming and should not be playing Starr at an age any younger than ⅔ of her actual age, so 18.70, meaning, based on Starr's approximated date of birth (see [[1980s]] references), that the scenes should be after April 26, 2007. One moment appears to say [https://i2.wp.com/caps.pictures/201/7-antman-wasp/full/antman-wasp-movie-screencaps.com-5634.jpg?strip=all "01-8 Thu"], suggesting it is Thursday, January 8, 2009. Evenly distributing between these two dates, the first set of scenes should be approximately September 29, 2007, March 4, 2008, and August 7, 2008, before then January 8, 2009. Then after that, the remaining scenes are between then and the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D. on January 12, 2014 (see [[2014]] references). Evenly distributing again, the remaining scenes should be January 9, 2010, January 11, 2011, January 12, 2012, and January 12, 2013.</ref><ref>''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]''</ref>

====21st====
[[File:Mary in Sokovian Prison.png|thumb|250px|Walker being held inside the [[Sokovia|Sokovian]] prison]]
*[[Mary Walker]] is captured while serving in [[Sokovia]], and four of her squad teammates are killed, the other three captured with her.<ref name="IF2 Mary Imprisonment">In ''[[A Duel of Iron]]'', Walker says she was freed after "22 months". On [https://marvel.propstoreauction.com/m/lot-details/index/catalog/198/lot/43094/?url=%2Fm%2Fview-auctions%2Fcatalog%2Fid%2F198%2F%3Fpage%3D8%26items%3D96 Marvel Television Live Auction Lot #886: Mary Walker's Classified Papers], it says Walker "served 8 years in various locals" before being "captured and held in isolation". Taking Alice Eve's age at the time of filming and working back from the setting, Mary Walker would have been born around September 1981. Given that she then could have joined the army no earlier than September 1998, the earliest she could have been kidnapped then would be January 1, 2006 (and calling it "8 years" in the general sense of "2006 - 1998 = 8") making the middle of her imprisonment roughly early December 2006 at the earliest. In ''[[Citadel on the Edge of Vengeance]]'', it is said that Walker's escape was "years ago", making it roughly late 2015 at the latest, so the middle of her imprisonment roughly January 2015 at the latest. Using the mid-point of this window to approximate, the middle of her imprisonment can therefore be calculated to be roughly December 21, 2010, making her imprisonment roughly January 21, 2010-November 21, 2011. The specifics of the calculation can be found [[User:Marvelus/Netflix (2017-) Shows Timeline#2010|here]].</ref>

====27th====
*Pepper Potts approaches Tony Stark as he tinkers with his [[Iron Man Armor: Mark IV|Mark IV Iron Man armor]] to ask him how he is dealing with the fact that he has five simultaneous dates scheduled for the evening. He states that he wants to finish a piece for his armor first, and then will come up with a plan.<ref name="IM Comics Between Films"/><ref name="IMLE">''[[Iron Man: Limited Edition]]''</ref>
*Stark dries to the [[The Rearview]] garage to speak with a mechanic, and is greeted by a worker named [[Mike Charles]]. However, as they talk, an explosion goes off by Stark's car, followed by gunshots.<ref name="IM Comics Between Films"/><ref name="IMLE"/>
*Stark leads Charles to a truck he owns, explaining that mercenaries must have followed him to the garage. Charles drives and Stark calls Potts, telling her he needs the Iron Man armor, giving her an access code to type into [[J.A.R.V.I.S.]] so it will be ready. He then tells Charles that they will take the fastest route back to his mansion and starts giving directions. Charles is confused, saying he knows where the mansion is and that this is not the way, but Stark asks to trust him.<ref name="IM Comics Between Films"/><ref name="IMLE"/>
[[File:Li006.jpg|thumb|250px|Stark and Charles escape in the truck]]
*Following Stark's instructions, Charles finds himself driving past a police parade. Stark explains that he used Charles' cell phone to look up events going on in the city and found out about it, choosing to pass so as to attract the authorities' attention. As they drive, he briefly leans out of the window to take a photo of the mercenaries' license plate.<ref name="IM Comics Between Films"/><ref name="IMLE"/>
*Stark continues to give instructions and chooses to pass by the apartment of two actresses, hoping they will see the commotion and that he will therefore have a good excuse for missing his date. Charles is bemused by Stark's motivation in the life-or-death situation.<ref name="IM Comics Between Films"/><ref name="IMLE"/>
*The pair finally drive to a bridge Stark has looked up on the phone to be opening soon. As it lifts, they drive the truck over it and jump the gap, landing on the other side and getting away from the mercenaries, who are unable to follow as the bridge is then too far open.<ref name="IM Comics Between Films"/><ref name="IMLE"/>
*[[Pepper Potts]] arrives and Stark says he needs to get back to [[Malibu]].<ref name="IM Comics Between Films"/><ref name="IMLE"/>
*Stark picks up his Iron Man armor from his mansion and flies to find the mercenaries. He pulls the man inside, [[Jenkins]], out of the vehicle.<ref name="IM Comics Between Films"/><ref name="IMLE"/>
*[[Iron Man]] flies back to Mike Charles and Pepper Potts with Jenkins in tow, to be arrested. Potts asks him if he has made a decision about his dates, and he says that he had to cancel them all. When Charles states that the women will be furious, Stark says that he is sure they will be - and tells him that that is why he gave them Charles' number, not his own, to Charles' horror.<ref name="IM Comics Between Films"/><ref name="IMLE"/>

===February===
====12th====
*A photograph of the [[Iron Man Armor: Mark I|Mark I Iron Man armor]] is uploaded online. In [[2015]], [[Ultron]] would access this image when scrolling through information to learn about the [[Avengers]].<ref name="AAoU">''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''</ref>F

====17th====
*As Tony Stark continues to operate as [[Iron Man]], he brings about a period of relative peace and is credited with stabilizing East-West relations, while maintaining a partying lifestyle.<ref name="IM Comics Between Films"/><ref name="IM2PI">''[[Iron Man 2: Public Identity]]''</ref>

====22nd====
[[File:Tumblr_md6qoePssg1qk6ramo1_1280.jpg|thumb|250px|Ross talking to [[Tony Stark]]]]
*[[Tony Stark]]'s main target in his operations as Iron Man are the [[Ten Rings]], who are based in [[Pavlodar]], [[Kabul]], and the Gulf of [[Aden]]. He saves an airman in the [[Congo]] who was test-piloting a vehicle designed by [[Justin Hammer]] under the orders of [[Thaddeus Ross]]. However, Stark realizes the [[palladium]] core of his [[Arc Reactor]] is slowly poisoning him, and while he searches for a cure he keeps his condition a secret.<ref name="IM Comics Between Films"/><ref name="IM2PI"/><ref name="TPic">''[[:File:Marvel-Movie-Universe.jpeg|Marvel's Timeline]]''</ref>

===March===
====4th====
*[[Tony Stark]] trials a new system for the Iron Man suit's delivery, but it fails.<ref name="IM/IM2/T/TIH 2009-10 Placements">The timeline placements for ''[[Iron Man (film)|Iron Man]]'', ''[[Iron Man 2]]'', ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'', and ''[[The Incredible Hulk]]'' are fraught with contradictions and problems. As detailed in [[:File:Marvel-Movie-Universe.jpeg|Marvel's official 2012 ''The Art of The Avengers'' timeline]], ''Iron Man'' spans 9 months from Tony's kidnapping to "I am Iron Man", then ''Iron Man 2'' is 6 months later. With Tony's birthday appearing in ''Iron Man 2'', which is May 29th (as shown on a [[:File:The Avengers Deleted Scene - Tony Stark File.png|file]] in a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pov4qMSfg9w deleted scene] from ''[[The Avengers]]'' and on [[:File:USC Avengers Props Exhibition.jpg|official display at an event]], and lines up with other evidence placing the film in May), ''Iron Man 2'' is set mostly in May, and ''Iron Man'' is February-November of the year before, which also lines up with its own evidence. However, the evidence for which years they are set in is contradictory.<br>A 2008 setting for ''Iron Man'' is implied by:
*A date on a TV in ''Iron Man'' which says "May 4, 2008".
*Vision's line from ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'', firmly on June 19, 2016, saying, "In the 8 years since Mr. Stark announced himself as Iron Man."
*A statement from Kevin Feige ([https://moviepilot.com/p/kevin-feige-peter-parker-mcu-origin-spider-man-homecoming/4234700 1], [http://www.aintitcool.com/node/77511 2]) implying 4 years between ''Iron Man'' and ''The Avengers'', which is firmly set in May 2012.
However, a 2009 setting for ''Iron Man'' is implied by:
*[[:File:Marvel-Movie-Universe.jpeg|Marvel's official timeline]] showing that "I am Iron Man" is 67 years after March 1942 (date [[:File:Tonsberg, Norway - March 1942.png|shown on-screen]] in ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]''), when Schmidt took the Tesseract, 67 years after June 22, 1943 (date [[:File:Nazis in New York.png|given by newspaper]] in ''Captain America: The First Avenger'' and [https://www.instagram.com/p/BG-WGtcr3Ub confirmed by Marvel]), when Steve went through Project Rebirth, 64 years after early February 1945 (date given by [http://www.icollector.com/Leaked-telegram-from-Col-Phillips_i12119993 auctioned prop from ''Captain America: The First Avenger''] and supported by [[:File:Rogers Disappears.jpg|newspaper in ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'' from a while after the disappearance]], as well as [[:File:Lovely picture.PNG|Reinhardt's arrest date a while after Red Skull's death, shown in ''The Things We Bury'']] - all explained in [[1940s]] references), when Steve went into the ice, meaning the timeline overall presents late 2009 for "I am Iron Man".
*Jon Watts saying that [http://www.pressreader.com/australia/empire-australasia/20170701/281513636097609 "the eight-year-old Peter had seen Stark say, 'I am Iron Man,' on TV,"] and [https://www.comicbookmovie.com/spider-man/homecoming/spider-man-homecoming-director-jon-watts-says-iron-man-was-always-part-of-the-film-a152207 again that Peter was 8 at that moment], with the fact that Peter was born in early 2001 (from [http://time.com/4312912/captain-america-civil-war-stephen-mcfeely-christopher-markus/ him being 15 in ''Captain America: Civil War''], June 2016, and "15" in ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'', September 2016, as well as [http://newyorkschooltalk.org/2016/10/nyc-give-parents-flexibility-kindergarten-start-dates/ a New York sophomore in 2016-17, meaning he was born in 2001]).
*''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.|Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'': [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D./Season Two|Season 2]], Episode 17 - ''[[Melinda]]'', set firmly in April 2015 in the lead-up to ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (see [[2015]] references), flashing back to "7 years ago" when the Avengers Initiative was just starting up, seemingly a while before ''Iron Man''.
A pre-2010 (2008 or 2009) setting is implied by:
*In ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', when Ultron scrolls through images, a [[:File:AAoU - FEB-12-2010.png|"FEB/12/2010"]] photo is shown of the Mark I armour. The photo could have been taken any time after the Mark I was made, but since the Mark I was only completed in May, this means it cannot be later than May 2009.
*In ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', when Ultron scrolls through images, an old "news archive" story about Iron Man is shown from [[:File:AAoU - 20.07.10.jpg|"20.07.10"]], including footage of him in Gulmira. This means that the Battle of Gulmira, in November of its year, can be no later than November 2009, for a news report from July 2010 to feature footage from it.
The second half of ''Iron Man 2'', the events of ''Thor'', and the second half of ''The Incredible Hulk'' are all set in the same week, known as "Fury's Big Week", as detailed in the ''[[The Avengers Prelude: Fury's Big Week]]'' comic, on Marvel's timeline, and shown in the films. ''Iron Man 2'' also cannot span more than a few weeks, because:
*The Expo is said to only be a year long, and there is "362 days left" on the day of Pepper's hiring and "343 days left" on the day of the Battle at Stark Expo.
*Tony jokes that Pepper has only been CEO for "a week" after the Expo fight. Although the "days left" just mentioned shows it has been 19 days, still, it cannot be any longer.
*The Monaco incident, which is after Pepper's hiring, is shown on [[:File:Marvel-Movie-Universe.jpeg|Marvel's timeline]] to still be 6 months after "I am Iron Man", when the senate meeting ''before'' her hiring is also said by Hammer to be "6 months" after the end of ''Iron Man'' and the Expo opening before ''that'' is shown to be "6 months later" (confirmed by Jon Favreau in DVD commentary to refer to the time since "I am Iron Man"). So, the Monaco incident is definitely within a month of the Expo opening.
*The inspired canon ''[[The Avengers: Iron Man Mark VII]]'' comic shows that the ice problem test flight in ''Iron Man'' is on or after "Day 1", that the fight in Monaco is between "Day 189" and "Day 199", and that the Battle at Stark Expo in Fury's Big Week is before "Day 199", meaning that the end of ''Iron Man 2'' is still just over 6 months maximum after.
*The rate at which Tony's palladium poisoning is increasing means that the film cannot realistically span more than a few weeks anyway.
A 2010 setting is implied for Fury's Big Week by:
*The [https://web.archive.org/web/20100420085102/http://www.starkexpo2010.com/ ''Stark Expo 2010'' website] saying that the Expo - the first Expo since 1974, the same one shown in the film - begins on "May 7th 2010".
*A letter on the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100420085102/http://www.starkexpo2010.com/ ''Stark Expo 2010'' website] also saying that the Expo begins on "May 7th . 2010".
*A computer in ''Iron Man 2'' saying "05.06.10".
*The Grand Prix de Monaco Historique appearing in ''Iron Man 2'', which is a biannual event which was held in May 2010.
*Blonsky being known to have been born on "March 1, 1971", as said in a deleted scene, and saying in ''The Incredible Hulk'' that he is "39".
*Fury saying Steve slept for "almost 70 years" in ''Captain America: The First Avenger'', Steve saying he slept for "70 years" in ''The Avengers'', and then more specific with "65 years" in ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' - overall implying he slept for about 66½-66¾ years. And, having gone into the ice in February 1945, this therefore implying he woke around late 2011, and ''The Avengers Prelude: Fury's Big Week'' shows that this is "one year later" after the end of Fury's Big Week.
*Tony Stark's file, on [[:File:USC Avengers Props Exhibition.jpg|display at an event]] and [[:File:The Avengers Deleted Scene - Tony Stark File.png|shown in a deleted scene from ''The Avengers'']], saying he was CEO of Stark Industries until 2010.
*Natasha saying to Bruce on May 2, 2012, "You've been more than a year without an incident. I don't think you wanna break that streak," when we know he had incidents in Harlem, then a month later in British Columbia (both in ''The Incredible Hulk''), and those incidents were in June and July respectively, meaning they cannot be 2011.
*The ''[[Iron Man 3 Prelude]]'' showing that 10 months before ''The Avengers'', in July 2011, enough time had passed since ''Iron Man 2'' that all of the damage at the Expo had been cleaned up, Stark Tower had been fully planned, the foundations had been laid, and the first few levels had already been constructed.
However, a 2011 setting for Fury's Big Week is implied by:
*Fury saying on May 4, 2012 in ''The Avengers'', "Last year, Earth had a visitor from another planet who had a grudge match that levelled a small town," implying the Battle of Puente Antiguo was last year.
*The ''[[Thor: The Dark World Prelude]]'' comic showing Darcy, on May 4, 2012, saying to Jane that "it's been a year", implying it has been a year since Thor left.
*Darcy saying in ''Thor: The Dark World'', "He's gonna come back. Except, you know, last time he was gone for like, 2 years," seemingly referring to it being 2 years from him leaving Jane before he returned on November 11, 2013 (but potentially just meaning, "Last time he left you, it was 2 years before he returned to Earth," referring to ''The Avengers'').
*The 2011 song ''Walk'' by Foo Fighters playing in a bar which Thor and Selvig visit during ''Thor''.
Fury's Big Week is 6 months after "I am Iron Man". This is shown from:
*Justin Hammer saying in ''Iron Man 2'', "We all know why we're here. In the last 6 months, Anthony Stark has created a sword with untold possibilities."
*Marvel's timeline showing that both the Ambush in Rio de Janeiro (which is shown in ''The Incredible Hulk'' to be "17 days" before Banner arrived at Culver University on Day 3 of Fury's Big Week) and the Duel of Monaco (which is days before Fury's Big Week) were 6 months after "I am Iron Man".
*''Iron Man 2'' beginning with "I am Iron Man" and showing a montage of Vanko working, then showing "6 months later", the Stark Expo opening. Jon Favreau confirmed on the DVD commentary that the Vanko montage covers the 6 months, with "6 months later" referring to the time since "I am Iron Man".
*Pepper joking in Monaco that Christine Everhart slept with Tony "last year" (which was 9 months before "I am Iron Man").
*The inspired canon ''The Avengers: Iron Man Mark VII'' comic showing about 197 days between the test flight with the icing problem and the Battle at Stark Expo.
So, ''Iron Man'' is set in February-November of 2008 or 2009, Fury's Big Week is set in May-June of 2010 or 2011, and Fury's Big Week is 6 months after "I am Iron Man".<br>The best solution possible, to satisfy the most evidence with the most importance, is reasoned out as ''Iron Man'' being set from February-November 2009 and Fury's Big Week being set in May-June 2010. To see a full, detailed description, calculation, and explanation of the reasoning, see [[User blog:BEJT/Full Analysis of All Evidence for Phase One's Timeline, Plus New Suggestion for Timeline Placements|here]].</ref><ref name="TAIMMVII Days">The ''[[The Avengers: Iron Man Mark VII]]'' comic shows that its "Day 189" is just before Tony leaves for the Grand Prix de Monaco Historique, and "Day 199" is a little while after the Battle at Stark Expo. With the Grand Prix dated to May 23, 2010 (see other references), this would imply that "Day 189" is May 22, 2010, fitting with "Day 199" being June 1, 2010, the day after the battle. This would then put "Day 1", shown to be the day of the test flight with the icing problem, on November 15, 2009, which lines up perfectly with the fact that ''[[Iron Man (film)|Iron Man]]'' presents the party the following day as being November 16, 2009, and then "I am Iron Man" being November 25, 2009 (see other references). The comic does contain recounts of the Battle of Gulmira and the Duel of Los Angeles on "Day 23" and "Day 30" respectively, but unlike with the test flight and the Duel of Monaco, shown actually playing out, they only appear as recounts. Because of the strong evidence putting the films in their November and May placements, this should not affect the timeline, but instead just be considered as Tony recounting those events during December, allowing the timeline to work out perfectly.</ref><ref name="TAIMMVII"/>

====19th====
*Test subjects are chosen for [[Project T.A.H.I.T.I.]], and they undergo the trials. Their results are monitored over the following weeks.<ref name="AoS2 T.A.H.I.T.I.">In ''[[The Writing on the Wall]]'', it is said on the reasoned date of March 16, 2015 that Rebecca Stevens was said to have died "5 years ago." This would place her supposed death around April 21, 2010. It can be assumed that the trials began around a month before this, approximately March 19, 2010, and that the preparations on Project T.A.H.I.T.I. would have begun around 3 months prior to that, approximately December 18, 2009.</ref>

====20th====
*In the Western Ghats, [[India]], [[Abby Rose]] prepares to drive for the [[Stark Industries]] racing team in a cross country rally. She is interviewed about the race and says she is confident that Royal Purple's gasoline will help her, as well as Tony Stark's shock absorbers. The interviewer asks her thoughts on whether the event should even be happening due to possible sabotage problems in earlier stages, but Rose says there is no proof of that. She admits, however, that her competition, [[Aiden Julius]] is a strong competitor, before getting in the car to start.<ref name="IM Comics Between Films"/><ref name="IMRPCC">''[[Iron Man Royal Purple Custom Comic]]''</ref>
[[File:Iron Man Royal Purple Custom Comic Abby Helps.png|thumb|250px|Rose helps Iron Man escape the Ten Rings]]
*Fifty miles from the start of the race, [[Iron Man]] discovers an illegal diamond mine. He spots a pickup truck arriving and believes they are carrying normal rifles. However, when he zooms in his vision, he realizes they are specifically trellor propellant rifles and spots a [[Ten Rings]] tattoo. They start to shoot, using diamond-tipped bullets to penetrate his armor. The Ten Rings then deploy an electromagnetic pulse, leaving him unable to fly away. Suddenly, Rose pulls up mid-race and opens the door to let him in. She drives to continue the rally and get away from the pursuing truck, while also contending with Aiden Julius.<ref name="IM Comics Between Films"/><ref name="IMRPCC"/>
*Iron Man asks Rose to slow briefly so he can warn Julius about what is happening. However, when he does so, they are shocked when Julius starts shooting at them. Rose realizes that the accidents in past races were an inside job, with Julius taking out the other cars to hide the illegal diamond mine.<ref name="IM Comics Between Films"/><ref name="IMRPCC"/>

When Banner wakes after the ambush, before his counter resets to "1 day without incident", it is shown that he had gone "190 days without incident". This would mean his last incident before the Ambush in Rio de Janeiro on May 14, 2010 would have been on November 5, 2009, and so the date on which the film begins with Banner's metronome, shown to be "158 days without incident", is April 12, 2010.</ref><ref name="TIH">''[[The Incredible Hulk]]''</ref>

====7th====
[[File:File34-Stark Expo 'memo'.jpg|thumb|250px|2010 Stark Expo]]
*The 2010 [[Stark Expo]] has its opening ceremony, and is due to then run for a year, followed by a closing ceremony. <ref name="IM/IM2/T/TIH 2009-10 Placements"/><ref name="SE2010 Site"/><ref name="IM2 Before FBW Placements">In ''[[Iron Man 2]]'', the scenes before Tony's birthday are set before Fury's Big Week begins. This scene is Day 1, May 29, 2010, with May 29th being Tony's birthday, as given on a file in a deleted scene from ''The Avengers'', and the same file displayed at an event, and lining up with the other evidence.
<br>The [https://web.archive.org/web/20100420085102/http://www.starkexpo2010.com/ ''Stark Expo 2010'' website] had Stark Expo supposedly starting on May 7, 2010. This just about lines up with the May 29th date. On the day Stark promotes Pepper, it is shown clearly in the background that there is "362 days remaining" of the Expo. On the date of the Expo battle, there is clearly "343 days remaining", so there is 19 days between these dates. It can then be seen that it takes Tony 4 days to return home after the senate, 5 days after the Expo opens. This would mean there is an opening day, 365 days of normal Expo, then the closing day, plus counting inclusively (ie. on closing day it says "1 day remaining"), meaning there is "367 days remaining" on May 7th, and thus 5 days later on the 12th, "362 days remaining". This way, these two dates gel very nicely.
<br>So, with the opening on May 7, 2010, Pepper's hiring on May 12, 2010, and Tony's birthday on May 29, 2010, somewhere between the May 12th and May 29th dates is Monaco. Monaco cannot be on May 1st/2nd like in real life, as it does not fit within these limits. But that is fine, as the ''Marvel Cinematic Universe'' is a different universe, so it can be different. It is still in the same ballpark as the real world. In an adaptation comic of ''Iron Man 2'', in the same scene where Rhodey confronts Tony about Vanko having attacked him "yesterday", "Natalie" then comes downstairs to say Tony's guests are arriving, and they have the discussion about Tony asking what she would do if she knew it were ''her'' last birthday. This would put Monaco the day before his birthday. However, this scene actually contradicts the film, which depicts the Rhodey conversation and the "Natalie" conversation as separate scenes in separate rooms. It can be put down to the adaptation condensing the film (like the ''Iron Man'' one putting Coulson asking for a meeting on "the 24th" at Tony's returning press conference rather than the party months later), and ignore this. The ''The Avengers: Iron Man Mark VII'' comic implies that "Day 189" is the day before Monaco, putting Monaco on Day 190. It implies as well that "Day 199" is around 2 days after Day 3 of Fury's Big Week, putting that on Day 5. This would put Day 1 around the Mark VII Day 195, 5 days after Monaco, therefore putting Monaco around May 24, 2010. However, it would work better on the 23rd, because the Grand Prix de Monaco Historique was held on a Saturday-Sunday in the real world, so it would make sense for it to be a Saturday-Sunday in the MCU as well. May 23, 2010 was a Sunday. The second day of the Grand Prix de Monaco Historique, in the real world, is supposed to be 2 weeks before the main Monaco Grand Prix (in this case, 2 weeks before May 16, 2010 - May 2, 2010). There is still some logic if the Grand Prix de Monaco Historique second day were 1 week after the main Grand Prix as a sort of after-party, rather than a build-up, which works as May 23rd. Plus, if Monaco is the 23rd, this puts "Day 189" on May 22, 2010, which then puts "Day 199" on June 1, 2010, the day after the Battle at Stark Expo, still working, and puts "Day 1" on November 15, 2009, which works perfectly with the timeline of ''Iron Man'' (see other references).</ref><ref name="IM2">''[[Iron Man 2]]''</ref>

*[[Matthew Ellis]] is elected President of the United States.<ref name="MCU Presidency">
Presidential elections in the ''Marvel Cinematic Universe'' are not the same as in the real world. For a while it was never outright stated that Obama was president in the ''Marvel Cinematic Universe'', but implied from Tony's poster, designed to resemble Obama's, in ''[[Iron Man 2]]'', the Obama biography in ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'', and the repeated references to him in ''[[Luke Cage (TV series)|Luke Cage]]'', that Obama was likely president at some point. Then in the ''[[Runaways (TV series)|Runaways]]'' episode ''[[Destiny]]'' it was confirmed, as Nico Minoru says, "You guys haven't had date night since the Obama Administration."<br>In December 2012, Aldrich Killian refers to President Ellis and says, "After years dodging the President's ban," implying Ellis has been president for years. Killian is also angry at Ellis' lack of involvement in the ''Norco'' incident, "2 years ago." It can also be assumed that Ellis was president when Steve woke in October 2011, as it is shown in ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'' that he is quoted as welcoming Steve back to the world.<br>In April 2015, Grant Ward says in ''[[A Fractured House]]'' that if his brother Christian were allowed to take him, his trial should then "wrap up right before the midterms". A newspaper in ''Captain America: Civil War'' also shows that it is an election year in 2016.
<br>From all of this, it can be assumed that, at least as of 2008, elections in the ''Marvel Cinematic Universe'' are every 2 years instead of every 4 years. Therefore, Obama would have been elected in November 2008. In May 2010, during Obama's presidency, Stark has a poster resembling Obama's. Ellis would have been elected in November 2010, and dealt with the December 2010 ''Norco'' incident and its aftermath as he came into his presidency. He would then have been president when Steve woke in October 2011, and in late December 2012, during ''Iron Man 3'', he would have been president for 2 years (just about fitting as "years"). Ellis would have been reelected in November 2014, and then the midterms would have been in November 2015, 7 months after Ward's statement. 2016 would then be the next election year, as shown in ''Captain America: Civil War''.</ref><ref name="IM3"/>

*Work begins on [[Stark Tower]].<ref name="IM3P Months">In the ''[[Iron Man 3 Prelude]]'' comic, it is shown as beginning a while after ''[[Iron Man 2]]'', with the damage from the Expo having been cleared up and Stark Tower having been fully planned, laid its foundations, and several levels into its construction. It then jumps to 2 months later, Mumbai, then 3 months later, Afghanistan, then 2 months later, Sudan, then 3 months later, Hong Kong, and this is shown to be the date of the Battle of New York, May 4, 2012. 3 months back from there would put Sudan around February 2012, 2 months further back would put Afghanistan around December 2011, 3 months further back puts Mumbai around September 2011, and a final 2 months back places the beginning in July 2011. This allows plenty of time, just over a year, for the Expo to be cleared completely and for the planning, foundations, and beginning of construction of Stark Tower. Several months prior to the beginning of the comic, work would have begun on the tower, around December 2011.</ref><ref name="IM3P">''[[Iron Man 3 Prelude]]''</ref>
