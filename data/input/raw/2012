This is a timeline of events that occurred in 2012.

==2012==
*[[Dinah Madani]] is sent to [[Kandahar]], [[Afghanistan]], where she works with [[Ahmad Zubair]] as a liaison to a [[United States Armed Forces]] mission.<ref>''[[Front Toward Enemy|The Punisher: 1.09: Front Toward Enemy]]''</ref>

====2nd====
[[File:Bauer-discouvery-darkhold-lockup.png|thumb|250px|[[Lucy Bauer]] and her husband find the [[Darkhold]]]]
*[[Lucy Bauer]] and her husband, [[Joseph Bauer]] find the [[Darkhold]] in the basement of the home's former owner and open it. When Lucy touches it, she discovers that she can read the text in English while Joseph can read it in German.<ref name="AoS405">''[[Lockup|Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 4.05: Lockup]]''</ref>

====9th====
*[[Phil Coulson]] tries to convince [[Nick Fury]] that [[Project T.A.H.I.T.I.]] must be shut down because of horrific side effects the drugs have on test subjects, which can only be mitigated by erasing the victim's memory. Despite his concerns, Project T.A.H.I.T.I. was not shut down.<ref name="AoS120">''[[Nothing Personal|Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 1.20: Nothing Personal]]''</ref>
*In [[Dubai]], [[Iron Man]] (in the [[Iron Man Armor: Mark VI|Mark VI armor]]) agrees to race women in similar suits. Eventually, the suits of the Dubai men malfunction and are destroyed.<ref name="TATAI Placement"/><ref name="TATAI">''[[The Avengers: The Avengers Initiative]]''</ref>

====10th====
*''{{WPS|The Fault in Our Stars}}'' by {{WPS|John Green (author)|John Green}} is published.<ref name="Real Events"/><ref name="AMatW">''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]''</ref>

====12th====
*[[Ghost]] phases to prevent herself from harm as she is shot at on a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] spy mission.<ref>In ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]'', several moments are shown from Ava Starr's past at S.H.I.E.L.D.. Hannah John-Kamen was 28.05 at the middle of filming and should not be playing Starr at an age any younger than â…” of her actual age, so 18.70, meaning, based on Starr's approximated date of birth (see [[1980s]] references), that the scenes should be after April 26, 2007. One moment appears to say [https://i2.wp.com/caps.pictures/201/7-antman-wasp/full/antman-wasp-movie-screencaps.com-5634.jpg?strip=all "01-8 Thu"], suggesting it is Thursday, January 8, 2009. Evenly distributing between these two dates, the first set of scenes should be approximately September 29, 2007, March 4, 2008, and August 7, 2008, before then January 8, 2009. Then after that, the remaining scenes are between then and the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D. on January 12, 2014 (see [[2014]] references). Evenly distributing again, the remaining scenes should be January 9, 2010, January 11, 2011, January 12, 2012, and January 12, 2013.</ref><ref>''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]''</ref>

====19th====
[[File:Romanoff Barton Fury.png|thumb|255px|[[Clint Barton]] and [[Natasha Romanoff]] talk to [[Nick Fury]]]]
*As part of a training exercise, [[Hawkeye]] disguises himself as a spy and breaks into the [[Helicarrier]] to trick the [[Black Widow]] into thinking he is stealing information about the [[Avengers Initiative]]. After the exercise, [[Nick Fury]] tells them the Initiative will only be put into action when the world needs the team most.<ref name="TATAI Placement">In ''[[The Avengers: The Avengers Initiative]]'', Fury's language implies that Steve has already woken, the World Security Council is just unsure if he'll be accustomed enough to join the Avengers. It is therefore set anywhere between October 9, 2011 and April 30, 2012 inclusive. Halfway between these dates would be January 19, 2012. The Iron Man Dubai incident is said to be "recent", placing it around 10 days prior, roughly January 9, 2011.</ref><ref name="TATAI"/>

====20th====
*During a fundraising event in [[New York City]], [[Barack Obama]] sings {{WPS|Al Green}}, who performed earlier at the same event.<ref name="Real Events">Sometimes the ''[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]'' alludes to events which happened in our world, and it is assumed they happened on the same dates in the universe, for timeline purposes.</ref><ref>''[[Suckas Need Bodyguards|Luke Cage: 1.06: Suckas Need Bodyguards]]''</ref>

===February===
====8th====
*[[War Machine]] fights the [[Ten Rings]]' allies in Northern [[Sudan]]. Afterwards, he travels to the {{WPS|Bagram Airfield}} in [[Afghanistan]] to discover more about the Ten Rings and contacts [[Tony Stark]] for advice.<ref name="IM3P Months">In ''[[Iron Man 3 Prelude]]'', it is shown as beginning a while after ''[[Iron Man 2]]'', with the damage from the Expo having been cleared up and Stark Tower having been fully planned, laid its foundations, and several levels into its construction. It then jumps to 2 months later, Mumbai, then 3 months later, Afghanistan, then 2 months later, Sudan, then 3 months later, Hong Kong, and this is shown to be the date of the Battle of New York, May 4, 2012. 3 months back from there would put Sudan around February 2012, 2 months further back would put Afghanistan around December 2011, 3 months further back puts Mumbai around September 2011, and a final 2 months back places the beginning in July 2011. This allows plenty of time, just over a year, for the Expo to be cleared completely and for the planning, foundations, and beginning of construction of Stark Tower. Several months prior to the beginning of the comic, work would have begun on the tower, around December 2011.</ref><ref name="IM3P">''[[Iron Man 3 Prelude]]''</ref>

====10th====
*[[Black Widow]] is sent to a mission in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], where she searches for missing [[Stark Industries]] technology. Disguised as Tatiana Sokolova, she works at a night club. While she tries to interrogate [[Mikhail Fjodorov]], one of the world's most successful illegal arms dealers, Fjodorov is killed by [[Sofia (Assassin)|an unknown woman]]. Romanoff is forced to leave the club, fighting several security men in the process. After she returns to a hotel, she is attacked by a team of masked mercenaries, but she defeats them and receives a SIM card to reach the mysterious woman she saw in the night club.<ref name="TAPBWS Placement">In ''[[The Avengers Prelude: Black Widow Strikes]]'' it is said, "Note: This story takes place between the events of ''Iron Man 2'' and ''Marvel's The Avengers''". This lines up with what Natasha says in ''Volume 2'', "They're connecting the capital to Sochi on the coast, where the Winter Olympics will be held in two years." This is referring to the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, which happened from February 7-23, 2014. 2 years prior would put this scene around February 15, 2012, and therefore the comic would revolve around this in February 2012, also lining up with it being set after ''Iron Man 2'' in 2010, before ''The Avengers'' in May 2012.</ref><ref name="TAPBWS1">''[[The Avengers Prelude: Black Widow Strikes]]'', Volume 1</ref>

====11th====
*Later, in the very early hours of the morning, [[Black Widow]] talks to the woman named [[Sofia (Assassin)|Sofia]], and learns that she is a "fan" and wants to take over the name "Black Widow". Romanoff agrees to meet with Sofia and breaks all her contacts with [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]<ref name="TAPBWS Placement"/><ref name="TAPBWS1"/>

*A few days later, Romanoff confronts Sofia in a sport hall in [[Sochi]], where she is defeated and almost drowned but she is saved at the last moment by [[Phil Coulson]], who is following a pair of goons working for the arms dealer [[Starodoub|General Starodoub]]. Coulson gives Romanoff the necessary equipment to infiltrate the yacht belonging to [[Yuri Klementiev]], one of General Starodoub's business partners, where she meets Sofia again, an encounter which costs them the life of agent [[Gennady Markov]].<ref name="TAPBWS Placement"/><ref name="TAPBWS2">''[[The Avengers Prelude: Black Widow Strikes]]'', Volume 2</ref>

====19th====
*[[Phil Coulson]] discovers that Sofia's employer is the billionaire [[Richard Frampton]], Romanoff infiltrates his headquarters in [[Vladivostok]]. She discovers that Frampton works for the [[Ten Rings]] terrorist organization and that he has made a [[Jericho]] missile that will explode near the border between [[Russia]] and [[North Korea]], greatly destabilizing the world peace. Romanoff infiltrates the launching area and destroys the missile. Both Frampton and Sofia are killed in the explosion.<ref name="TAPBWS Placement"/><ref name="TAPBWS3">''[[The Avengers Prelude: Black Widow Strikes]]'', Volume 3</ref>

====17th====
*[[Eli Morrow]] is contacted by Bauer who shows him, [[Hugo]], [[Vincent]] and [[Frederick]] her invention. Tempted by the power and knowledge of the [[Darkhold|book]], [[Eli Morrow]] asks Joseph to give him the book claiming that the book will kill them all.<ref name="AoS406"/>

====21st====
*A few days later, tired of him, Joseph hires and orders the [[Fifth Street Locos]] to kill Morrow.<ref name="AoS406"/>

====22nd====
*[[Robbie Reyes]] steals the [[Hell Charger|car]] that belongs to his uncle [[Eli Morrow]], when [[Gabe Reyes]] catches him. However, Gabe decides to join him.<ref name="AoS406">''[[The Good Samaritan|Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 4.06: The Good Samaritan]]''</ref><ref name="AoS407">''[[Deals With Our Devils|Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 4.07: Deals With Our Devils]]''</ref>

**However, as the Reyes brothers are cruising along the neighborhood, the [[Fifth Street Locos]], who were hired to murder [[Eli Morrow]], shoot up the car with [[Robbie Reyes]] and [[Gabe Reyes]] in it.<ref name="AoS406"/>
**[[File: Blaze.png|thumb|250px|[[Johnny Blaze]] revives [[Robbie Reyes]]]]The car flips and sends Reyes flying through the air, as he prays to anyone to keep his brother safe. Reyes is killed on impacting the ground and Gabe loses control of his legs. However, [[Johnny Blaze]], Ghost Rider, contacts Robbie's soul and asks if he wants Gabe to live, in which Reyes responds yes. Soon after, Blaze pulls Gabe to safety and revives Reyes by transforming him into the next Ghost Rider.<ref name="AoS406" />

====23rd====
*The next day, [[Eli Morrow]] beats Joseph into a coma but also he questions him on where the [[Darkhold]] is. When [[Hugo]], [[Frederick]] and [[Vincent]] show up Morrow uses the Quantum Particle Generator to transform them into spiritual entities and contains every one of them on different boxes.<ref name="AoS406"/>

That machine ghosted that Lucy woman." Agent Mackenzie replies, "So what, Coulson and Fitz come back in 5 years, bloody and insane?" The implication from this is that Mackenzie has been told that Bauer spent 5 years in the box, before her release on the reasoned day of March 19, 2017.</ref>
*The police from [[Los Angeles]] police department arrives at the scene and takes Morrow into custody for attempt of murder.<ref name="AoS406"/>
