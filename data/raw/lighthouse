=====Lighthouse Timeline=====
*Phil Coulson decides not to take the Centipede Serum yet, as it does not feel right to him in case there is still a chance for it to be used to stop Talbot.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS5 Original Timeline">In ''[[The End]]'', the agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. manage to change the timeline so that instead of the world cracking apart as it did originally, in the new timeline, the world is saved. While there are no obvious changes in the timeline until Melinda May and Leo Fitz save Alphonso Mackenzie and Polly Hinton, the change Robin Hinton senses in the episode is shown to be the fact that the Centipede Serum was slipped into Quake's gauntlets by Phil Coulson. This means that the timelines in fact diverge just before Coulson hands Quake her suit, and also fits with Robin Hinton's comment in ''[[The Last Day]]'' that Coulson would "bring all the pieces together", being his action that changes the timeline. For a short while after, events play out almost identically, with the only difference being that, without anyone except Coulson knowing, the serum is in fact in Quake's gauntlets. Coulson still does not, at least initially, take the serum in the original timeline as Quake was filmed in that timeline shouting at him in an identical manner to how she shouts at him in the new timeline for not taking it. The first sign of the timeline change, however, is Mackenzie and Hinton being saved, and then events begin to significantly diverge, being completely different once Quake finds the serum.<br>While we are shown very little of 2018 of the original timeline outside of ''The Last Day'', we can assume that events are almost identical until Mackenzie and Hinton are saved. This includes the scenes in ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' where Thanos talks to Gamora on the ''Sanctuary II'' and takes her to see Nebula, which occur concurrently with the events of ''The End'' between the divergence point and the beginning of actual significant signs of divergence.<br>The gaps in the original timeline can then be put together - the serum was left on Zephyr One, Mackenzie and Hinton died in the ship, Quake was absorbed by Talbot, Talbot destroyed the world, and finally what Yo-Yo Rodriguez alludes to in ''[[Past Life]]'' - as the world burned, May and Fitz got back to Zephyr One with Robin Hinton, but without Polly Hinton or Alphonso Mackenzie. They reached to grab them from the first of the surface to pull them on-board, but Mackenzie was not there. This is then followed by the "2018" scene of ''The Last Day''.<br>There is also one thing we know from the original timeline that can be assumed for the new timeline, since events are occurring almost identically at the given point - that someone is filming when Quake leaves the Quinjet and shouts at Coulson (explained in ''The Last Day'').<br>It is unclear what happened to Coulson in the original timeline. The serum is left on Zephyr One, but he does not appear to survive past 2018 anyway. Still, wherever events are unclear, they are excluded from the events descriptions.</ref>
*<!--07:50:39-07:53:02-->Daisy Johnson admits to the team that she let her emotions get the better of her, and feels she cannot lead the team. Instead, she suggests that [[Alphonso Mackenzie]] take charge due to his big heart and cool head, and everyone else agrees. Coulson then enters, seemingly revitalized by the serum, expressing his approval. He hands Johnson her suit and asks Mackenzie what they will be doing next, to which he replies, "We save lives."<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS5 Original Timeline"/>
*<!--07:54:27-08:00:23-->On-board the ''[[Sanctuary II]]'', [[Thanos]] hands [[Gamora]] food, but she throws it aside. She says she hated his [[Space Throne|chair]], the room, the ship - her entire life with him. Thanos says he knows, having been constantly reminded for the almost 20 years she spent with him. He claims that he saved her, and that [[Zen-Whoberi]] was on the brink of collapse until he saved the [[Zehoberei]] people, with the murder of half the population having simply been necessary to bring about a peace and prosperity he claims they now live in, calling it "salvation". Thanos explains that he believes he is the only being with the will strong enough to act on the fact that life needs culling and correcting, since otherwise finite resources will run dry and cause everyone's extinction. He says that she, too, shared that will for a time, and that this was why he entrusted her with finding the [[Soul Stone]]. Gamora pretends to be apologetic, saying she is sorry she did not find it, but Thanos says that he knows she did, and is disappointed that she lied.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS5 Original Timeline"/>
*Thanos takes Gamora to see [[Nebula]], whom he has imprisoned, suspended mid-air with her cybernetic parts separated. He explains that she sneaked on-board to try to kill him recently, but that he had caught her and cycled through her memory files, finding one particular memory of importance. Playing it to her, Gamora sees that Thanos found a discussion between the sisters in which Gamora had told Nebula she secretly had found a map to the Soul Stone and burned it. Thanos demands that Gamora tell him where the stone is, and uses the [[Infinity Stones]] he has acquired to control Nebula's parts, forcing them to separate further and further and causing her agony until Gamora eventually gives in, unable to stand it any longer. She reluctantly informs him that it is on the planet [[Vormir]].<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS5 Original Timeline"/>
*<!--07:57:54-07:58:40-->The [[Chicago Police Department]] tell [[Glenn Talbot]] to stand down, but worry that there is not much they are able to do. However, at that moment the citizens' phones ring with an announcement from [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], read by [[Alphonso Mackenzie]]. He tells them they have an aircraft for civilian evacuation, that they will clear buildings in danger of collapse, and not to engage Talbot as they will handle it.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS5 Original Timeline"/>

She tells them about her [[Polly Hinton|mother]] being taken, and Mackenzie goes to find her.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS5 Original Timeline"/>
*<!--08:03:50-08:04:05-->Mackenzie climbs up into Talbot's ship to search for Polly Hinton.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS5 Original Timeline"/>
*<!--08:03:50-08:05:59-->[[Quake]] and [[Phil Coulson]] land, and Johnson tells Coulson to come with her so he can talk Talbot down. However, Coulson reveals that he is unable to, as he can barely stand, having in fact not taken the [[Centipede Serum]]. He tells her that she needs to be confident in her own abilities, having been trained by him, and says she needs to talk to Talbot herself - and if it is ineffective, to take him down. She leaves the Quinjet and angrily shouts at him to return to Zephyr One and take the serum, exclaiming that the agents fought to give him it, and he cannot just refuse.<ref name="AoS5 Original Timeline"/> An onlooker films her leaving the jet and shouting.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS508">''[[The Last Day|Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 5.08: The Last Day]]''</ref>

**<!--08:09:49-08:11:28-->[[Quake]] tells [[Glenn Talbot]] that he is already the hero he wants to be, as anyone who signs up to help protect the world despite the potential great loss it can entail already is one.

He grabs hold of her and begins to fly into the air.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS5 Original Timeline"/>

**<!--08:11:46-08:12:15-->In the crater in the ground formed by their impact, Talbot grabs hold of the winded Quake again and begins to use his powers to attempt to absorb her, saying that it will be easier to get through to the [[gravitonium]] in the ground once he can use her absorbed powers to quake the ground apart.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS5 Original Timeline"/>

**<!--08:13:30-08:15:44-->[[Glenn Talbot]] uses his powers to break through the ground, but unintentionally causes a massive seismic event of Richter scale 12.8 that causes Planet [[Earth]] to begin to crack into pieces.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS5 Original Timeline"/>
**<!--08:14-08:19-->As [[Chicago]] cracks, the epicenter of the world's destruction, [[Leo Fitz]] and [[Melinda May]] rush back to [[Zephyr One]] with [[Robin Hinton]].

*<!--08:15:26-08:22:10-->[[Thor]] surprises [[Rocket Raccoon]] when he understands [[Groot]]'s language, having learned it on [[Asgard]]. He sits down and Rocket realizes he is mourning his brother, walking to the back of their ship to speak to him. He tries to reassure Thor, but Thor ends up lamenting his numerous recent losses: [[Loki]], [[Hela]], [[Odin]], [[Frigga]], and [[Heimdall]]. He tries to steel himself and turn his mourning into motivation for the task at hand, killing [[Thanos]], and insists he is capable, but when Rocket asks what would happen if Thor is wrong, he momentarily chokes on his words, overcome with grief as he asks what more he could possibly lose, before getting up to prepare for their arrival in [[Nidavellir]]. Rocket hands Thor a cybernetic eye he stole from a man on [[Contraxia]], wanting to help him for the coming challenges by giving him his full vision back. Thor places it in his empty eye socket and regains full vision as they arrive at Nidavellir. However, Thor is concerned to see that Nidavellir is not lifeless and colorful, but dark and seemingly empty.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS5 Original Timeline"/>
*Thor, Rocket, and Groot land on Nidavellir and look around the apparently abandoned forges. They come across a mold for the [[Infinity Gauntlet]] and become concerned, but before they can do anything they are ambushed by [[Eitri]], the king of the dwarves. When he sees it is Thor who has come, he exclaims that Asgard was supposed to protect Nidavellir, but never came. Thor explains that Asgard is gone, and Eitri sadly tells Thor that [[Thanos]] came to Nidavellir and threatened the lives of all 300 dwarves if they did not forge him the Infinity Gauntlet to harness the power of the [[Infinity Stones]], yet when they did, he still slaughtered all the other dwarves except him, melting metal around his hands so he can never forge something for anyone else. Thor tries to encourage him, saying there are still ways he can help and asking to work with them so he can kill Thanos.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS5 Original Timeline"/>
*<!--08:37:14-08:37:59-->A [[Chitauri]] guard pieces [[Nebula]] back together following her torture at Thanos' hands.

*<!--08:48-08:49-->On [[Zephyr One]], [[Jemma Simmons]] lets the agents know that two more cities have gone dark as the world continues to fall apart. [[Robin Hinton]] wanders through the plane as [[Melinda May]] flies it back to the [[Lighthouse]], and an agent asks where her mother is, but Simmons sadly explains that Polly did not make it. Robin walks up to May, who asks her to go downstairs, but Robin mutters that it will be okay, they survive "the crash" May is confused, but suddenly Zephyr One hits a gravity storm and crashes to the surface of the planet. While the agents make it to the Lighthouse, the plane remains on the surface of the broken planet for the following decades.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS508"/>
