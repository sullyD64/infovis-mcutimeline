{{Quote|That's great.  You did the hardest part. You took the jump, You didn't know where you were gonna come down. And that's it. That's those little brave baby steps we gotta take... to try and become whole again, try and find purpose. I [[Battle in the Valkyrie|went in the ice]] in [[1940s#1945|'45]], right after I met the [[Peggy Carter|love of my life]]. Woke up 70 years [[2011|later]]. You gotta move on. Gotta move on. The [[Earth|world]] is in our hands. It's left to us, guys. And we gotta do something with it. Otherwise... [[Thanos]] should've [[Snap|killed]] all of us.|[[Captain America]]|Avengers: Endgame}}

[[File:Endgame 04.jpg|thumb|250px|Steve Rogers gives therapy]]
*[[Steve Rogers]] gives therapy to a group of [[Snap]] survivors.<ref name="AE October 2023 Placement">In ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', events begin in mid-2018, then the film jumps to "five years later", making it 2023. This is supported later when, in 2014, Ebony Maw says that Nebula has come from "9 years in the future", 2023. In ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'', Betty Brant says on the last day of school, in late June, that the snapped people were brought back "8 months" ago. This would place Hulk's snap in October, so October 2023. 11 days after Hulk's snap there is a full moon over Wakanda, which would be the night of October 28, 2023, making Hulk's snap October 17, 2023. This means in conclusion that ''Avengers: Endgame'' spans October 3-30, 2023.</ref><ref name="AE">''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''</ref>

[[File:Time-Space GPS (2).png|thumb|250px|The Avengers prepare to travel back in time]]
*'''[[Time Heist]]''': After extensive group discussions, the Avengers decides to go back in time to retrieve the six [[Infinity Stones]] and use the combined set to undo the damage they had done. They are split into three groups: Scott, Steve, Bruce, and Tony head for [[2012]] [[New York City]], as both the [[Space Stone|Space]] and [[Mind Stone]]s were involved in the [[Battle of New York]], and the [[Time Stone]] at the [[New York Sanctum|Sanctum Santorum]]; Thor and Rocket head for [[2013]] Asgard, where the [[Reality Stone]] was located prior to [[Sacking of Asgard|the Dark Elves' arrival]]; and Clint, Natasha, Rhodes, and Nebula head for planet [[Morag]] in 2014, with the former two leaving on the ''[[Benatar]]'' (which had been carried back [[Pym Particles|miniaturized]]) to get the [[Soul Stone]] on [[Vormir]], and the others staying to get the [[Power Stone]] before [[Star-Lord]] does so.<ref name="AE October 2023 Placement"/><ref name="AE"/>
**Minutes after leaving, the Avengers return, with one exception: Natasha, who [[Sacrifice of Natasha Romanoff|took it upon herself to be the necessary sacrifice]] that summons the Soul Stone for Clint to take back.

*'''[[Blip]]''': A custom-made [[Infinity Gauntlet]] is equipped with all the Stones and then worn by Banner, who feels he is the only one powerful enough to perform the snap and survive - as well as his higher tolerance to the Gamma radiation which was emanating from the Stones. Despite significant damage to his right arm, all life that had been wiped out returns, proven once [[Laura Barton]] calls her husband.<ref name="AE October 2023 Placement"/><ref name="AE"/>
[[File:Avengers vs Thanos.jpg|thumb|250px|Captain America, Iron Man and Thor confront Thanos]]
*'''[[Attack on the New Avengers Facility]]''': While the other Avengers concluded their mission, the past Nebula executed her own. She hacks into the time machine and opens a portal back to 2014, allowing Thanos' flagship, the ''[[Sanctuary II]]'', to be transported into the future. The vessel then fired all its weapons on the headquarters, destroying it and the time machine, though all the Avengers survive.<ref name="AE October 2023 Placement"/><ref name="AE"/>
**Following 2014 Thanos destroying the Avengers Facility, he thinks over his future self's victory and the Avengers' plan, deciding he will wipe away the universe to be the god of the next. This leads into a fight with Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America. Using a [[Mjølnir]] that Thor brought back from 2013, Rogers is able to match Thanos for a time, until the latter gets a foothold and uses his [[Double-Edged Sword|sword]] to cleave Cap's shield in two.<ref name="AE October 2023 Placement"/><ref name="AE"/>

With their combined forces, they fight off Thanos' army. When trying to take the [[Nano Gauntlet]] out of Thanos' reach to prevent his plan of universal oblivion and renewal, Ant-Man remembers Luis' Van has a portal, the Avengers aimed to use it to get rid of the Infinity Gauntlet, passing the Gauntlet across themselves on the way to the car. As Thanos orders an air strike, Captain Marvel returns to provide an assist, taking the gauntlet for a dash to the portal, but Thanos still destroys the van. As the Avengers do all they can to stop Thanos from getting the Infinity Gauntlet, it is when Thanos uses the raw energy of the Power Stone to knock out Captain Marvel, that Stark gets an idea when Doctor Strange gestures that they are now within the one outcome he saw where Thanos was defeated. Grabbing the gauntlet, Stark steals the Infinity Stones and equips them to his armor's glove.<ref name="AE October 2023 Placement"/><ref name="AE"/>
