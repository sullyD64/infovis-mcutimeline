==c. 4,540,000,000 B.C.==
*Planet [[Earth]] is formed.<ref>The Earth is estimated to be 4.54 billion years old.</ref>

[[File:Books Power Stone.png|thumb|250px|[[Eson the Searcher]] using the Power Stone.]]
*The [[Celestials]] use the Power Stone to impose judgment upon enemy civilizations. Over time, the [[Cosmic Beings]] are overwhelmed by the Stone's power and attempt to dispose of it by encasing it in an [[Orb]] and storing it away in the [[Temple Vault]] on [[Morag]].<ref name="GotG"/><ref name="GotGV2 Celestials">In ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]'', Ego says he has been building his planet, since he came into existence, for "millions of years".
<br>"Millions" would technically refer to a minimum of 2 million years, and a maximum realistically of 9.99999. It can be up to 19.99999, which is just before it becomes "tens of millions", so a weighted average means the maximum is roughly 13.33333 million years. This would mean that "millions" strictly refers to approximately, to find the midpoint, (2 + 13.33333) ÷ 2 = 7.66667 million years.<br>However, it is rare for people to refer to "tens of millions" or "hundreds of millions", and this needs to be taken into account - that Ego may simply be referring to any number ending in "millions" (be it units, tens, or hundreds). The middle of these is tens of millions, which is absolute minimum 10 and realistic minimum 20, to realistic maximum 99.99999 and absolute maximum 199.99999. Therefore, with weighted averages, it is roughly minimum 16.66667 million years, maximum 133.33333 years, and the midpoint of these is (16.66667 + 133.33333) ÷ 2 = 75 million years.<br>Finally, averaging these two figures, you get around (7.66667 + 75) ÷ 2 = 41.33333 million years as an approximation for the term "millions".<br>Ego then later says "millions and millions". This is also a hard number to quantify, but can be boiled down to either meaning "millions + millions" (so × 2), or "millions on top of millions", like building to the power of 2 (so × 2², or × 4). From this, one could say that it is around × (2 + 4) ÷ 2 = × 3. Therefore, one could approximate that "millions and millions" means roughly 41.33333 × 3 = 124 million years.<br>The average of ''these two'' is then (41.33333 + 124) ÷ 2 = 82.66667 million years, meaning overall that Ego was born ''very'' approximately 82,666,666.66667 years before 2014. This gives roughly 82,664,653 B.C. - or c. 80,000,000 B.C. to 1 significant figure (to signify that it is a ''very'' rough approximation).<br>The Celestial scenes shown by the Collector in ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' can be assumed to have occurred around the same era.</ref>
*The Celestial [[Ego]] is born. After gaining self-consciousness, Ego creates layers of matter around himself, eventually forming a new planet over millions of years. Ego also creates an humanoid avatar and explores the universe in an attempt to find life besides himself, but feels disappointed in what he finds. Eventually, he begins [[Ego's Expansion|planting seeds on many of these worlds]], with the intent of one day using them to absorb all life until only he remains.<ref name="GotGV2 Celestials"/><ref>''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]''</ref>

A meteorite consisting primarily of vibranium collided with Earth about 2.5 million years ago at what is now Wakanda."<br>2,500,000 years before the events of ''Black Panther'' in [[2016]] gives roughly 2,497,985 B.C. - or c. 2,500,000 B.C. to 3 significant figures (to signify that it is an approximation).</ref><ref name="BP">''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]''</ref>

<br>"More than 32,000" would suggest about 32,000 + 1000 × ⅙ = 32,166.66667 years, meaning overall that Enoch came to life approximately 32,166.66667 years before late 2091.

Looking at the {{WPS|Evolution of human intelligence#Homo sapiens intelligence|evolution of human intelligence}}, this is most likely what is estimated in 2018 to have been 30,000 years ago. 30,000 years before 2018 gives roughly 27,983 B.C. - or c. 28,000 B.C. to 3 significant figures (to signify that it is a rough approximation with a scientific factor).</ref>

*The five tribes of Wakanda live in constant war with each other until, one day, a warrior shaman named [[Bashenga]] receives a vision from the panther goddess [[Bast]], who leads him to the [[Heart-Shaped Herb]]. Bashenga ingests the plant and it grants him superhuman strength, speed, and instincts. He becomes king and the first Black Panther, the protector of [[Wakanda]].

Four tribes agreed to live under the king's rule, but the Jabari tribe isolated themselves in the mountains."

*[[Buri]], the first king of [[Asgard]], is born.<ref name="Asgardian Ageing">In ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'', Odin says, "We are not gods. We are born, we live, we die. Just as humans do," to which Loki replies, "... Give or take 5000 years." The implication from this is that Asgardians live approximately 5000 years longer than humans. It is also known that Asgardians age at the same rate as humans until adulthood, before their ageing slows down. Based on weighted averages of Tom Hiddleston (whose figures have less weight, considering Loki is not actually Asgardian, but ages at a rate very close to them) and Chris Hemsworth's ages when they shot the films they feature in, and weighted averages of the dates those films are set, working with Loki's known date of birth in 965 A.D. and Thor's known date of birth around 964 A.D., and then taking another weighted average of these two actors/characters' figures, the result is that Asgardians age like humans up to roughly the age of 20.4, before ageing about 99.3 × slower. The exact details are explained in detail [[User blog:BEJT/Asgardian Ageing Calculations|here]].</ref><ref>Based on the Asgardian ageing calculations (see other references), Bor would have been born around late 5244 B.C., Odin around mid-3480 B.C., and Hela around early 679 B.C.. This means that Bor had Odin, his first born, at around 1763.7 years old, and Odin had Hela, ''his'' first born, at around 2800.6 years old. A weighted average of these gives 2109.4, which can be used as an approximation for Buri's age when he had his first born, Bor. 2109.4 years before late 5244 B.C. places Buri's birth around mid-7353 B.C..

"Thousands" would strictly refer to a minimum of 2000 years, and a maximum of 9999.99999 - up to 19,999.99999, just before it becomes "tens of thousands" - so a weighted average of roughly maximum 13,333.33333 years. This would mean that "thousands" strictly refers to approximately, to find the midpoint, (2000 + 13,333.33333) ÷ 2 = 7666.66667 years, suggesting the Masters were formed approximately 7666.66667 years before 2017, around 5651 B.C. - or c. 5700 B.C. to 2 significant figures (to signify that it is a very rough approximation).</ref><ref name="DS">''[[Doctor Strange (film)|Doctor Strange]]''</ref>

"Centuries" would technically refer to a minimum of 200 years, and a maximum of 999.99999 - up to 1999.99999, just before it becomes "milennia", so a weighted average of roughly maximum 1333.33333. This would mean that "centuries" strictly refers to approximately (200 + 1333.33333) ÷ 2 = 766.66667 years, suggesting the Hand were formed approximately 766.66667 years before November 2015, around early 1249.<br>In ''[[Royal Dragon (episode)|Royal Dragon]]'', Stick says of Alexandra and the Hand's plots, "Nobody knows when it started. Centuries ago? Millennia? It doesn't matter." The mix of the two implies that it is around the upper limit of centuries, and the lower limit of millennia, which is 2000 years, suggesting the Hand were formed approximately 2000 years before May 2016, around 16 A.D.<br>While an average of these two figures would usually be taken, this average would place the formation around 632 A.D., which is too late, as they are said to have been responsible for Vesuvius' eruption, which was in 79 A.D. Therefore, the second, later information will be the only reference used to approximate the formation of the Hand, as it does not contradict the first either - Stick is approximating both times. Therefore, it can be estimated that the Hand was formed c. 16 A.D., as a very rough approximation.</ref>

*'''[[Massacre of the Valkyrie]]''': After nearly 1600 years of imprisonment, [[Hela]] attempts to escape from her prison of [[Hel]]. Her father and the man who imprisoned her, [[Odin]], sends his army of [[Valkyries]] on their [[Valkyrie Steeds|flying steeds]] to keep her at bay. They attempt to prevent her escape, but Hela is too much for them and she massacres the whole army, save for [[Brunnhilde]], who is saved by one of her teammates. [[Odin]] intervenes and enters Hel. The All-Father manages to overpower and reimprison [[Hela]].<ref name="TR"/><ref name="TR Massacre">In ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'', it is shown that the Massacre of the Valkyrie was during Hela's imprisonment, and Thor implies that the Valkyrie were all gone before he was born. Brunnhilde's age is not indicative of how long ago it was, as she may well have aged slower on Sakaar, which is said to be a location where time "runs funny", and where there is no linear correlation to real time. However, Hela looks to be a similar age - as close to her age in ''Thor: Ragnarok'' as possible. With this being before Thor's birth in 964 A.D., there is a minimum of 1053 years, about 10.6 human years (as once they reach adulthood, Asgardians age around 99.3 × slower than humans - for full details, see [[User blog:BEJT/Asgardian Ageing Calculations|here]]). It cannot be much longer than this, so is c. 950 A.D..</ref>

This is during a time when he is pretending that Loki is his biological son (and that Hela never existed), and so despite Loki not technically being "born" of Odin, this is still a statement showing that Thor is older than Loki. The scene from ''Thor'' where they are children is set at a time when the brothers are ageing at the same speed as humans, before they have reached adulthood, and Dakota Goyo and Ted Allpress are very close in age. As well as this, when Thor tells the story in ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' of how Loki turned into a snake, he finishes by saying, "We were 8 at the time," meaning they are less than a year apart in age.<br>With Asgardians ageing as normal until adulthood, it can be assumed that they also have the same gestation period of around 9 months. Therefore, for the adoption of Loki not to arouse suspicion, the brothers should be at least around 11 months apart - a realistic minimum gap between siblings. Therefore, with Loki's date of birth dated to mid-965 A.D., it can be assumed that Thor was born around mid-964 A.D.</ref>
