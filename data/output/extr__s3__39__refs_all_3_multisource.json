    "desc": "The timeline placements for <i>[[Iron Man (film)|Iron Man]]</i>, <i>[[Iron Man 2]]</i>, <i>[[Thor (film)|Thor]]</i>, and <i>[[The Incredible Hulk]]</i> are fraught with contradictions and problems. As detailed in Marvel's official 2012 <i>The Art of The Avengers</i> timeline, <i>Iron Man</i> spans 9 months from Tony's kidnapping to \"I am Iron Man\", then <i>Iron Man 2</i> is 6 months later. With Tony's birthday appearing in <i>Iron Man 2</i>, which is May 29th (as shown on a file in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pov4qMSfg9w\">deleted scene</a> from <i>[[The Avengers]]</i> and on official display at an event, and lines up with other evidence placing the film in May), <i>Iron Man 2</i> is set mostly in May, and <i>Iron Man</i> is February-November of the year before, which also lines up with its own evidence. However, the evidence for which years they are set in is contradictory.<br>A 2008 setting for <i>Iron Man</i> is implied by:*A date on a TV in <i>Iron Man</i> which says \"May 4, 2008\".*Vision's line from <i>[[Captain America: Civil War]]</i>, firmly on June 19, 2016, saying, \"In the 8 years since Mr. Stark announced himself as Iron Man.\"*A statement from Kevin Feige (<a href=\"https://moviepilot.com/p/kevin-feige-peter-parker-mcu-origin-spider-man-homecoming/4234700\">1</a>, <a href=\"http://www.aintitcool.com/node/77511\">2</a>) implying 4 years between <i>Iron Man</i> and <i>The Avengers</i>, which is firmly set in May 2012.However, a 2009 setting for <i>Iron Man</i> is implied by:* showing that \"I am Iron Man\" is 67 years after March 1942 (date shown on-screen in <i>[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]</i>), when Schmidt took the Tesseract, 67 years after June 22, 1943 (date given by newspaper in <i>Captain America: The First Avenger</i> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BG-WGtcr3Ub\">confirmed by Marvel</a>), when Steve went through Project Rebirth, 64 years after early February 1945 (date given by <a href=\"http://www.icollector.com/Leaked-telegram-from-Col-Phillips_i12119993\">auctioned prop from <i>Captain America: The First Avenger</i></a> and supported by newspaper in <i>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</i> from a while after the disappearance, as well as Reinhardt's arrest date a while after Red Skull's death, shown in <i>The Things We Bury</i> - all explained in [[1940s]] references), when Steve went into the ice, meaning the timeline overall presents late 2009 for \"I am Iron Man\".*Jon Watts saying that <a href=\"http://www.pressreader.com/australia/empire-australasia/20170701/281513636097609\">\"the eight-year-old Peter had seen Stark say, 'I am Iron Man,' on TV,\"</a> and <a href=\"https://www.comicbookmovie.com/spider-man/homecoming/spider-man-homecoming-director-jon-watts-says-iron-man-was-always-part-of-the-film-a152207\">again that Peter was 8 at that moment</a>, with the fact that Peter was born in early 2001 (from <a href=\"http://time.com/4312912/captain-america-civil-war-stephen-mcfeely-christopher-markus/\">him being 15 in <i>Captain America: Civil War</i></a>, June 2016, and \"15\" in <i>Spider-Man: Homecoming</i>, September 2016, as well as <a href=\"http://newyorkschooltalk.org/2016/10/nyc-give-parents-flexibility-kindergarten-start-dates/\">a New York sophomore in 2016-17, meaning he was born in 2001</a>).*<i>[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.|Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]</i>: [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D./Season Two|Season 2]], Episode 17 - <i>[[Melinda]]</i>, set firmly in April 2015 in the lead-up to <i>[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]</i> (see [[2015]] references), flashing back to \"7 years ago\" when the Avengers Initiative was just starting up, seemingly a while before <i>Iron Man</i>.A pre-2010 (2008 or 2009) setting is implied by:*In <i>[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]</i>, when Ultron scrolls through images, a \"FEB/12/2010\" photo is shown of the Mark I armour. The photo could have been taken any time after the Mark I was made, but since the Mark I was only completed in May, this means it cannot be later than May 2009.*In <i>Avengers: Age of Ultron</i>, when Ultron scrolls through images, an old \"news archive\" story about Iron Man is shown from \"20.07.10\", including footage of him in Gulmira. This means that the Battle of Gulmira, in November of its year, can be no later than November 2009, for a news report from July 2010 to feature footage from it.The second half of <i>Iron Man 2</i>, the events of <i>Thor</i>, and the second half of <i>The Incredible Hulk</i> are all set in the same week, known as \"Fury's Big Week\", as detailed in the <i>[[The Avengers Prelude: Fury's Big Week]]</i> comic, on Marvel's timeline, and shown in the films. <i>Iron Man 2</i> also cannot span more than a few weeks, because:*The Expo is said to only be a year long, and there is \"362 days left\" on the day of Pepper's hiring and \"343 days left\" on the day of the Battle at Stark Expo.*Tony jokes that Pepper has only been CEO for \"a week\" after the Expo fight. Although the \"days left\" just mentioned shows it has been 19 days, still, it cannot be any longer.*The Monaco incident, which is after Pepper's hiring, is shown on Marvel's timeline to still be 6 months after \"I am Iron Man\", when the senate meeting <i>before</i> her hiring is also said by Hammer to be \"6 months\" after the end of <i>Iron Man</i> and the Expo opening before <i>that</i> is shown to be \"6 months later\" (confirmed by Jon Favreau in DVD commentary to refer to the time since \"I am Iron Man\"). So, the Monaco incident is definitely within a month of the Expo opening.*The inspired canon <i>[[The Avengers: Iron Man Mark VII]]</i> comic shows that the ice problem test flight in <i>Iron Man</i> is on or after \"Day 1\", that the fight in Monaco is between \"Day 189\" and \"Day 199\", and that the Battle at Stark Expo in Fury's Big Week is before \"Day 199\", meaning that the end of <i>Iron Man 2</i> is still just over 6 months maximum after.*The rate at which Tony's palladium poisoning is increasing means that the film cannot realistically span more than a few weeks anyway.A 2010 setting is implied for Fury's Big Week by:*The <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20100420085102/http://www.starkexpo2010.com/\"><i>Stark Expo 2010</i> website</a> saying that the Expo - the first Expo since 1974, the same one shown in the film - begins on \"May 7th 2010\".*A letter on the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20100420085102/http://www.starkexpo2010.com/\"><i>Stark Expo 2010</i> website</a> also saying that the Expo begins on \"May 7th . 2010\".*A computer in <i>Iron Man 2</i> saying \"05.06.10\".*The Grand Prix de Monaco Historique appearing in <i>Iron Man 2</i>, which is a biannual event which was held in May 2010.*Blonsky being known to have been born on \"March 1, 1971\", as said in a deleted scene, and saying in <i>The Incredible Hulk</i> that he is \"39\".*Fury saying Steve slept for \"almost 70 years\" in <i>Captain America: The First Avenger</i>, Steve saying he slept for \"70 years\" in <i>The Avengers</i>, and then more specific with \"65 years\" in <i>[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]</i> - overall implying he slept for about 66½-66¾ years. And, having gone into the ice in February 1945, this therefore implying he woke around late 2011, and <i>The Avengers Prelude: Fury's Big Week</i> shows that this is \"one year later\" after the end of Fury's Big Week.*Tony Stark's file, on display at an event and shown in a deleted scene from <i>The Avengers</i>, saying he was CEO of Stark Industries until 2010.*Natasha saying to Bruce on May 2, 2012, \"You've been more than a year without an incident. I don't think you wanna break that streak,\" when we know he had incidents in Harlem, then a month later in British Columbia (both in <i>The Incredible Hulk</i>), and those incidents were in June and July respectively, meaning they cannot be 2011.*The <i>[[Iron Man 3 Prelude]]</i> showing that 10 months before <i>The Avengers</i>, in July 2011, enough time had passed since <i>Iron Man 2</i> that all of the damage at the Expo had been cleaned up, Stark Tower had been fully planned, the foundations had been laid, and the first few levels had already been constructed.However, a 2011 setting for Fury's Big Week is implied by:*Fury saying on May 4, 2012 in <i>The Avengers</i>, \"Last year, Earth had a visitor from another planet who had a grudge match that levelled a small town,\" implying the Battle of Puente Antiguo was last year.*The <i>[[Thor: The Dark World Prelude]]</i> comic showing Darcy, on May 4, 2012, saying to Jane that \"it's been a year\", implying it has been a year since Thor left.*Darcy saying in <i>Thor: The Dark World</i>, \"He's gonna come back. Except, you know, last time he was gone for like, 2 years,\" seemingly referring to it being 2 years from him leaving Jane before he returned on November 11, 2013 (but potentially just meaning, \"Last time he left you, it was 2 years before he returned to Earth,\" referring to <i>The Avengers</i>).*The 2011 song <i>Walk</i> by Foo Fighters playing in a bar which Thor and Selvig visit during <i>Thor</i>.Fury's Big Week is 6 months after \"I am Iron Man\". This is shown from:*Justin Hammer saying in <i>Iron Man 2</i>, \"We all know why we're here. In the last 6 months, Anthony Stark has created a sword with untold possibilities.\"*Marvel's timeline showing that both the Ambush in Rio de Janeiro (which is shown in <i>The Incredible Hulk</i> to be \"17 days\" before Banner arrived at Culver University on Day 3 of Fury's Big Week) and the Duel of Monaco (which is days before Fury's Big Week) were 6 months after \"I am Iron Man\".*<i>Iron Man 2</i> beginning with \"I am Iron Man\" and showing a montage of Vanko working, then showing \"6 months later\", the Stark Expo opening. Jon Favreau confirmed on the DVD commentary that the Vanko montage covers the 6 months, with \"6 months later\" referring to the time since \"I am Iron Man\".*Pepper joking in Monaco that Christine Everhart slept with Tony \"last year\" (which was 9 months before \"I am Iron Man\").*The inspired canon <i>The Avengers: Iron Man Mark VII</i> comic showing about 197 days between the test flight with the icing problem and the Battle at Stark Expo.So, <i>Iron Man</i> is set in February-November of 2008 or 2009, Fury's Big Week is set in May-June of 2010 or 2011, and Fury's Big Week is 6 months after \"I am Iron Man\".<br>The best solution possible, to satisfy the most evidence with the most importance, is reasoned out as <i>Iron Man</i> being set from February-November 2009 and Fury's Big Week being set in May-June 2010.

The date when Johnson and Simmons enter the Framework is reasoned as April 30th (see other references), and in <i>[[Farewell, Cruel World!]]</i> it is shown that the beginning of the episode is now 10 days later, putting this on May 10th. This fits, as on May 10th Coulson says that \"up until a week ago\" he would have thought he was mad to believe in the real world, and May says that \"[her] squad's been hunting [Simmons for] the past week.\" These are both references to events on May 1st being roughly a week ago, and the \"10 days\" timespan would put those events 9 days prior, which works well enough as an approximate week, and shows that time in the Framework does indeed pass normally. <i>Identity and Change</i> ends on May 1st, and working back from the May 10th date, <i>No Regrets</i> would begin on May 9th, putting an 8-day gap between the episodes. Placing <i>No Regrets</i> to <i>[[World's End]]</i> around the May 10th date puts those events from May 9th to May 12th."

    "desc": "Evidence in <i>[[Iron Fist (TV series)|Iron Fist]]</i>: [[Iron Fist (TV series)/Season Two|Season 2]] places its events in 2018, while evidence in <i>[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]</i>: [[Daredevil (TV series)/Season Three|Season 3]] places its events in 2017.<br><i>Iron Fist</i>: Season 2 takes place after the events of <i>[[Luke Cage (TV series)|Luke Cage]]</i>: [[Luke Cage (TV series)/Season Two|Season 2]], as is evidenced by Rand being in New York City in <i>[[The Main Ingredient]]</i> but leaving the country after <i>[[A Duel of Iron]]</i>, Hai-Qing Yang appearing late in <i>Luke Cage</i>: Season 2 and being killed early in <i>Iron Fist</i>: Season 2, and Misty Knight having her bionic arm given during <i>Luke Cage</i>: Season 2, as well as referring to her offer of a promotion from that season. <i>Luke Cage</i>: Season 2 takes place firmly in August-September 2017 (see other references), making this no earlier than September 2017. In <i>[[War Without End]]</i>, the \"spring fair\" is being planned in Chinatown - the fair for Chinese New Year, thus meaning it is coming up, making it the run-up to February 16, 2018. This is supported by Colleen Wing, in <i>[[The Fury of Iron Fist]]</i>, offering to give Lana Tsai \"kids' winter stuff\", implying it is winter, as well as there being cold weather throughout the season. It is also supported by a laptop in <i>[[The City's Not for Burning]]</i> with a <a href=\"https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/File:20180912_160414_(2).jpg\">January 2018 date</a>. The laptop also shows that it is 18:58 and dark outside, putting it roughly between October 5, 2017 and March 10, 2018 regardless of the January date. And, in <i>[[Target: Iron Fist]]</i>, Misty Knight says, \"This is probably not next year's Christmas card,\" implying that Christmas has been fairly recently, if next Christmas is still being considered \"next year's\" (even though it would be \"this year\"), being in the wake of the last Christmas.<br>The main events of <i>Daredevil</i>: Season 3 are said to be \"months\" since the events of <i>[[The Defenders]]</i>: [[The Defenders/Season One|Season 1]], firmly in Spring 2016 (see [[2016]] references). The official synopsis says, \"Missing for months, Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) reemerges a broken man.\" In <i>[[No Good Deed]]</i>, Murdock says, \"I've had a rough couple of months, Foggy. Questioning a lot of... the point of it all.\" This would imply merely 2 months since he woke, \"weeks\" after the main events of <i>[[The Defenders (episode)|The Defenders]]</i>, but this is impossible. It can either be taken that Murdock is using \"couple\" the informal way to mean \"few\", or just that only in the last couple of months of his hiding has he started questioning things, though this would not have been long after he recovered. So, either way, this still implies not long since <i>The Defenders</i>. Then, in <i>[[The Perfect Game]]</i>, Karen Page is asked, \"When's the last time you heard from Matt Murdock?\", and replies, \"Um... months,\" though it can be taken that she is trying to downplay the length of time, without actually lying. It is also generally strongly implied that not much time passes following <i>The Defenders</i> before the main events of the season. In <i>[[Reunion (Daredevil)|Reunion]]</i>, it is said that Fisk was wrongly convicted \"2 years\" ago, and in <i>[[One Last Shot]]</i> it is said that Vanessa Marianna was protected for \"2 years\". With Fitz's arrest and Marianna going into hiding both being February 2015 (see [[2015]] references), this would suggest it is now early 2017. It is also clearly around winter-time, so it would seem on this evidence alone that it is early 2017, about 8 months after <i>The Defenders</i>: Season 1.<br>However, these are not mutually compatible, as the main events of <i>Iron Fist</i>: Season 2 take place before the main events of <i>Daredevil</i>: Season 3, with references in <i>[[This Deadly Secret]]</i> and <i>[[Citadel on the Edge of Vengeance]]</i> to Danny Rand carrying out Matt Murdock's mission (given to him in <i>The Defenders</i> when Murdock thought he was going to die and wanted Rand to fight in his place), implying Murdock is still thought deceased. The official synopsis for <i>Iron Fist</i>: Season 2 says, <a href=\"https://www.comicbookmovie.com/tv/marvel/iron_fist/iron-fist-season-2-synopsis-reveals-that-danny-rand-is-stepping-up-to-take-daredevils-place-a162297\">\"This season, Danny has promised that with Matt Murdock gone, he will step up and protect his city,\"</a> confirming Murdock is still thought dead. All of <i>Iron Fist</i>: Season 2, except for its epilogue, should therefore take place before the reappearance of \"Daredevil\" during the attack on the New York Bulletin Building in <i>[[The Devil You Know]]</i>, followed shortly by Murdock's public reappearance. Some compromise has to be made wherein <i>Daredevil</i>: Season 3 is later than early 2017, and <i>Iron Fist</i>: Season 2 is earlier than early 2018.<br><i>Iron Fist</i>: Season 2 can be dragged earlier, but at the absolute earliest it is late 2017, with the spring fair committee taken to be planning far ahead of time - a few months. This is a stretch, but again, necessary to make it work. And there are a few things that work better with <i>Iron Fist</i>: Season 2 being late 2017: in <i>The Fury of Iron Fist</i>, Rand says he \"missed the last 15 years of culture\", having been missing for almost 15 years and now catching up, and while not particularly including the time since he returned, it nonetheless implies it is still close to 15 years since he went missing, and 2017 is 16 years rather than 2018 being 17; in <i>The Fury of Iron Fist</i> and <i>This Deadly Secret</i>, it is said that it is \"months\" since Joy and Ward Meachum last spoke, which is implied to be referring if not to [[Iron Fist (TV series)/Season One|Season 1]] then to a time shortly after then, so the shorter the span between Season 1 and 2 the better; Misty Knight is still considering the captain offer, has taken leave to ponder it, and is implied to have not seen Luke Cage since <i>[[They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.)]]</i>, which works much better as a month or so after the end of <i>Luke Cage</i>: Season 2 in September 2017 than a few months later; in <i>[[Morning of the Mindstorm]]</i> it is said that Rand has been \"all over Chinatown for months\", which is implied to be referring if not to <i>The Defenders</i>: Season 1 then to a time shortly after then, so the shorter the span between then and this season the better; the epilogue of <i>A Duel of Iron</i> \"months later\" fits more comfortably before <i>[[Avengers: Infinity War]]</i> in May 2018 if <i>A Duel of Iron</i> is late 2017 than early 2018, and it should be before <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MRavenMetzner/status/1040696708131254272\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UqrlizXWIM&t=2015s\">2</a>).<br><i>Daredevil</i>: Season 3 can be pushed to late 2017, at the latest. This causes problems in relation to <i>The Defenders</i>: Season 1, as it makes it roughly 17 months since then, when it is implied to be only a few months. It somewhat works as \"months\", being only over a year, not yet a year-and-a-half or 2 years, but it is a big stretch. You certainly cannot push it further, as this is the latest it can be while still being considered \"2 years\" since early 2015, as well as the absolute most you can stretch the gap since <i>The Defenders</i>: Season 1. But some evidence does in fact support late 2017: this works better with the line in <i>The Perfect Game</i> from Benjamin Donovan, \"an early and very white Christmas\"; the season has to be after <i>Luke Cage</i>: Season 2 (finishing September 2017) as, not only is it after <i>Iron Fist</i>: Season 2 which is after <i>Luke Cage</i>; Season 2, but Karen Page is referenced in <i>[[The Creator]]</i> as still working as a reporter, when she loses that job and begins working for Nelson, Murdock and Page in <i>Daredevil</i>: Season 3; most importantly, the DA election occurred in New York City in the real world in late 2017.<br>With <i>Daredevil</i>: Season 3 pushed forward to its absolute limit and <i>Iron Fist</i>: Season 2 pulled back to its absolute limit, they can just about be pulled to meet at late 2017.<br>There is some evidence for it being very late 2017: heavy snow is shown during <i>Daredevil</i>: Season 3, which works significantly better are November-December than October-November, and the later in 2017, the better for <i>Iron Fist</i>: Season 2 as it is closer to early 2018. However, the majority of the evidence, with a late 2017 placement, would point to October-November 2017: in <i>[[Aftermath]]</i>, is it shown to be 57°F at 18:30 in New York City, which would suggest ideally approximately late October (or mid-to-late April); <i>Iron Fist</i>: Season 2 is seemingly not long after Knight's job offer in <i>Luke Cage</i>: Season 2, with Knight still considering the captain job offer; it is slightly closer to <i>The Defenders</i>: Season 1 (17 months rather than 18/19 - keeping it under a year-and-a-half), so just slightly more plausible for the mentions of \"months\"; it is also slightly closer to <i>Iron Fist</i>: Season 1, again fitting slightly better with the implications of \"months\"; it is slightly more plausible as \"2 years\" since early 2015; it makes it under 16 years since Danny Rand's plane crash when he says he missed \"the last 15 years of culture\"; most importantly, it fits with the real New York City DA election - it would be odd to align with late 2017 but not quite line up with a big timeline indicator (especially since <i>They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.)</i> establishes at least some election dates as the same in the <i>MCU</i>), and the election's inclusion can be taken as an indication that it was not meant to be right at the end of the year, despite the snow. So, the two seasons should be in the lead-up to the November 7, 2017 election, as late as possible.<br>The final scenes of <i>Daredevil</i>: Season 3, still before the election, are a Friday (working forward from Poindexter saying in <i>No Good Deed</i> that it is Tuesday). As late as possible makes it Friday, November 3, 2017. Working back, this puts the attack on the <i>New York Bulletin</i> building on October 27, 2017.<br>The seasons should overlap as much as possible, to allow <i>Iron Fist</i>: Season 2 to be as late (close to its ideal early 2018) as possible. So, Rand leaving in the plane should be as late as possible while still before the attack on the <i>New York Bulletin</i>. The day of Rand leaving is a Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday, based on dialogue in the season. Taking it to be Friday (the exact same day as the attack on the <i>New York Bulletin</i>), however, also allows the ambush on Fisk's convoy to fall comfortably in the gap between <i>Morning of the Mindstorm</i> and <i>Citadel on the Edge of Vengeance</i> in <i>Iron Fist</i>: Season 2, thus meaning that this major event, worthy of citywide news, not being addressed during <i>Iron Fist</i>: Season 2 is not a problem. So, the end of the main events of <i>Iron Fist</i>: Season 2 can be taken to be Friday, October 27, 2017.<br>Working back from there, <i>Iron Fist</i>: Season 2 spans 18 days at an absolute minimum, meaning the latest it can start is Monday, October 9, 2017. However, in <i>The Fury of Iron Fist</i>, Rand jokes that their date nights should become a regular occurrence, \"every Tuesday\", implying it is currently Tuesday. The latest Tuesday it can be, therefore, is Tuesday, October 3, 2017, with the season spanning 24 days (other than the epilogue). This is a more suitable length, considering the battle at Golden Tigers' Hideout is referred to in <i>Morning of the Mindstorm</i> as \"a few weeks ago\" (this pushes it to 2 weeks prior) as well as Rand's recovery from injury - said to be incredibly fast, but still spanning some time - now taking 15 days, while taking into consideration that it is not possible to stretch the season a further week, to start on September 26, 2017, since the passage of time in the season does not fit with much more than the approximate 24 days.<br>Finally, when aligned side-by-side, this gives:*October 3-20, 2017: <i>The Fury of Iron Fist</i>-<i>Morning of the Mindstorm</i>.*October 22-23, 2017: <i>Resurrection</i> ending-<i>No Good Deed</i> opening.*October 24, 2017: <i>Citadel on the Edge of Vengeance</i> opening/<i>No Good Deed</i>.*October 25, 2017: <i>Citadel on the Edge of Vengeance</i>-<i>War Without End</i> opening/<i>[[Blindsided]]</i>.*October 26, 2017: <i>War Without End</i>-<i>A Duel of Iron</i> opening/<i>The Perfect Game</i>.*October 27, 2017: <i>A Duel of Iron</i>/<i>The Devil You Know</i>-<i>Aftermath</i> opening.*October 28-November 3, 2017: <i>Aftermath</i>-<i>[[A New Napkin]]</i>."

It should first be established that <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> takes place over a little under 24 hours, from Wednesday (as shown on Tony Stark's flip phone) to Thursday.<br>As for <i>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</i>, Episode 19 - <i>[[Option Two]]</i> to Episode 22 - <i>[[The End]]</i> take place concurrently with <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> over Wednesday-Thursday. Episode 18 - <i>[[All Roads Lead...]]</i> ends 9 days before <i>Option Two</i> (see other references), so the prior Monday. Working backwards, Episode 14 - <i>[[The Devil Complex]]</i>, takes place earlier the Thursday 4 days before that.<br>Overall:*Thursday Week 1 - Episode 14 - <i>The Devil Complex</i>. Beginning of Episode 15 - <i>Rise and Shine</i> events.*Friday Week 1 - Episode 15 - <i>Rise and Shine</i> \"24 hours ago\" events.*Saturday Week 1 - End of Episode 15 - <i>Rise and Shine</i> events.*Sunday Week 1 - Episode 16 - <i>Inside Voices</i> events, Episode 17 - <i>The Honeymoon</i> events, beginning of Episode 18 - <i>All Roads Lead...</i> events.*Monday Week 2 - End of Episode 18 - <i>All Roads Lead...</i> events.*Wednesday Week 3 - Beginning of <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> events/Episode 19 - <i>Option Two</i> events, Episode 20 - <i>The One Who Will Save Us All</i> events, beginning of Episode 21 - <i>The Force of Gravity</i> events.*Thursday Week 3 - End of Episode 21 - <i>The Force of Gravity</i> events, Episode 22 - <i>The End</i> events/End of <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> events/<i>Ant-Man and the Wasp</i> credits scenes.Now it needs to be established which weeks in the timeline this applies to.<br>First, there is a latest possible date for the events of <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i>. The Wednesday of <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> is still during school time, as Peter Parker is on a school field trip. <i>[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]</i> establishes that Parker restarted <a href=\"http://www.slashfilm.com/spider-man-homecoming-2-avengers-4/\">junior year</a> after returning in the Blip, making him a junior at the time of the Snap. With Parker beginning sophomore year in <i>[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]</i> in September 2016, he would finish junior year in June 2018. This means that the Wednesday of <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> should be before Tuesday, June 26, 2018, when New York high schools finished for summer (<a href=\"http://schools.nyc.gov/Calendar/default.htm\">1</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hsas-lehman.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Calendar17-18.pdf\">2</a>, <a href=\"http://hsmse.org/about-us/school-calendar/\">3</a>). If necessary, it can be assumed that either Parker's school finished 1 day later than most, or the New York high schools in the <i>MCU</i> finished 1 day later than those in the real world, making Wednesday, June 27, 2018 the absolute latest that <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> could begin.<br>The earliest possible date is January 2018, as all these events must take place in 2018. This is evidenced by many things:*<i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> takes place 2 years after the main events of <i>Captain America: Civil War</i>, which are firmly placed in June 2016 (see [[2016]] references).**In <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i>, Vision says, \"Wanda, for 2 years, we've stolen these moments, trying to see if this could work.\"**Later, Rhodes says to Rogers, Romanoff, and Wilson, \"You guys really look like crap.

Jimmy Woo says, \"As a part of his joint plea deal with Homeland Security and the German government, he was allowed to return to the U.S., provided he served 2 years under house arrest.\"**Later, Lang says to van Dyne, \"Give me a break, I haven't driven in 2 years.\"**At the end of his sentence, Scott asks Woo, \"Are my 2 years up already?\"**<a href=\"http://comicbook.com/marvel/2018/06/25/ant-man-wasp-avengers-infinity-war-timeline-feige/\">Kevin Feige stated, \"[Scott Lang] answered a call when heroes needed him and now he's been under house arrest for 2 years.\"</a>*The <i>Captain Marvel</i> mid-credits scene, 3 weeks after <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i>, is 23 years after the main events of the film, which are firmly placed in June 1995.**<a href=\"https://www.comicbookmovie.com/avengers/avengers_endgame/kevin-feige-addresses-carol-danvers-23-year-absence-between-captain-marvel-and-avengers-endgame-a167142\">Kevin Feige referred to \"the last 23 years\".</a>*<i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> takes place 5 years before <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>, which takes place 9 years after 2014 (so 2023).**In <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>, it is shown that the events are \"five years later\" after 3 weeks after <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i>. It is further confirmed that <i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i> takes place in \"2014\" on-screen. In these scenes, Ebony Maw says Nebula is from \"9 years\" in the future, making it 2023.*<i>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</i>: Season 5, Episodes 14-22 take place in 2018.**In Episode 8 - <i>[[The Last Day]]</i>, a flashforward is shown with events that, as shown in Episode 22 - <i>The End</i>, would take place on the Thursday of <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i>, and the on-screen text specifically says \"2018\".**The agents return to the present day in Episode 11 - <i>[[All the Comforts of Home]]</i>. Later that day, Yo-Yo Rodriguez has her arms sliced off. The agents perform surgery on her amputated arms, and she begins to heal. 2 days later, in Episode 12 - <i>[[The Real Deal]]</i>, the monitor by her bed shows \"12-06-2017\", making it December 6, 2017 (see [[2017]] references for reasons this is a firm placement). By Episode 14 - <i>The Devil Complex</i>, the skin on Rodriguez's arm stumps has healed over, which takes 4 weeks to 2 months (<a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/definition-amputation#2-5\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sharecare.com/health/amputation-physical-disability/take-to-recover-from-amputation\">2</a>). With Rodriguez having lost her arms and had surgery performed on them on December 4, 2017, earliest that <i>The Devil Complex</i> can take place is January 2018, thus meaning that from Episode 14 onward, it is 2018.**In Episode 15 - <i>Rise and Shine</i>, events set at the time of [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D./Season Three|Season 3]], Episode 17 - <i>[[The Team]]</i> and Episode 18 - <i>[[The Singularity]]</i> in April 2016 are shown on-screen to have been \"2 years ago\".**In Episode 16 - <i>Inside Voices</i>, events set immediately after [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D./Season One|Season 1]], Episode 22 - <i>[[Beginning of the End]]</i> in January 2014 are shown on-screen to have been \"four years ago\".So, all of these events take place in the first half of 2018. However, there is contradictory evidence for when exactly in the first 6 months of the year. <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i>, <i>Ant-Man and the Wasp</i>, <i>The Punisher</i>, and <i>Jessica Jones</i> would suggest closer to June 2018, while <i>Thor: Ragnarok</i>, <i>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</i>, and <i>Spider-Man: Far From Home</i> would suggest closer to January 2018.<br>Scott Lang's 2-year house arrest coming to an end would imply that it has been 24 months since the end of the main events of <i>Captain America: Civil War</i>. In that film, Lang is arrested on June 24, 2016 (a firmly established date - see [[2016]] references). Steve Rogers breaks him out of the Raft 2 days later, on June 26, 2016, and very soon after (as shown in <i>[[Avengers: Infinity War Prelude]]</i>), Lang returns home after making his deal. The exact date that the sentence would end depends on a few factors, such as when the sentence counts as beginning from, if it counts from his initial imprisonment then whether each day spent in prison counts as double towards his sentence, and if time could be/was removed. At the earliest, the house arrest would finish on June 20, 2018. At the latest, June 27, 2018. The arrest finishes on a Wednesday, and at the very shortest, the events of <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> start 1 week later (as at least one more weekend is shown to occur before the end of the film) on the following Wednesday. The very last day that the events of <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> can possibly begin is Wednesday, June 27, 2018, so the latest Lang's house arrest could end would also be the earliest: Wednesday, June 20, 2018. This would also line up well with the references to the time between previous films and <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i>, with them placing it ideally closer to mid-2018 than early.<br>However, there are several things in <i>Thor: Ragnarok</i>, <i>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</i>, and <i>Spider-Man: Far From Home</i> suggesting it is much earlier in the year.*Firstly, <i>Thor: Ragnarok</i> is firmly set in 2017 (see [[2017]] references). At the very latest, it takes place in November-December 2017, before <i>All the Comforts of Home</i> on December 4, 2017, which features a reference to the events of the film. There is a jump in time between the end of the main events of the film and the film's mid-credits scene, which is set mere minutes before the opening of <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i>. However, the gap should be minimal, for several reasons:**The film finishes with Thor deciding to head back to Earth. Only in the mid-credits scene do he and Loki seem to actually begin discussing the problems with bringing Loki back to the planet. This would imply that it is very soon after the decision was made.**Thor's hair is exactly the same in <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> as it is in <i>Thor: Ragnarok</i>, including the streak on the side from the Watcher Informant's poor cutting. While it's possible that Asgardian hair grows slower than humans', it nonetheless implies very little time has passed.**The <i>Statesman</i> has a few hundred Asgardians on board that need food and water and other general living standards, and the ship itself is highly unlikely to have enough on board to sustain a few hundred people for very long. It is possible that they could have gone a little longer if one assumes they stopped at other places for resources on the way and/or that Asgardians need less sustenance than humans, but nonetheless, the longer the gap, the more and more assumptions have to me made.*<i>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</i>: Episode 12 - <i>The Real Deal</i> is firmly set on December 6, 2017, as given by the \"12-06-2017\" date on Rodriguez's monitor, and which lines up with all the other evidence as mentioned above. Episode 13 - <i>Principia</i> takes place shortly after and, as is evidenced by the \"12-17-2017\" date and Coulson's mention of \"tidings of comfort of joy\", it is Christmas. When Episode 14 - <i>The Devil Complex</i> begins, it is heavily implied to be merely another several days later:**In Episode 12 - <i>The Real Deal</i>, the team discover that Coulson is dying. For them, it has been only a few days since Coulson made the deal with Ghost Rider, yet it has become quite bad. They do not know when he will die, but considering it took just a few days to get this bad, it would be strange for it to take several further months to kill him.**In Episode 13 - <i>Principia</i>, Fitz says in December 2017, \"The, uh, the gravitonium device that we used to seal the rift is barely strong enough. It's duct tape on the Hoover Dam. It's not gonna hold.\" Coulson asks, \"How much time before the dam starts leaking?\", and he says, \"Well, uh, it's hard to calculate that precisely, but, based on the increased frequency of transit, electromagnetic waves, I'd say that our days were numbered.\" While he clearly does not know exactly how long they have, the implication is absolutely no more than a couple of weeks.**In Episode 14 - <i>The Devil Complex</i>, Simmons says she would like to have a honeymoon with Fitz, implying they recently married. In Episode 17 - <i>The Honeymoon</i>, Simmons jokes about this being their honeymoon, implying they recently got married.**In Episode 14 - <i>The Devil Complex</i>, Mackenzie is testing Rodriguez's newly made robotic arms. They got the arms from Hale's mechs in <i>Principia</i>. Considering how fast they usually work, it really should not take them very long to make the arms.**In Episode 14 - <i>The Devil Complex</i>, Mackenzie says to Rodriguez, \"Your arms aren't fully healed yet. What you need is time.\" Rodriguez replies, \"My arms may not work, but my eyes do. At least let me sit in Control, keep an eye out for anomalies.\" Mackenzie says, \"Maybe, but you have to allow yourself to heal. We'll handle the fighting for now.\" As well as this, Rodriguez is still in her hospital-esque bed for a lot of the episode. This implies that she is still healing and still needs to be taken care of, which should not be for more than a couple of months absolute maximum.**In Episode 14 - <i>The Devil Complex</i>, Deke Shaw is still a bit dazed about having worked out that Fitz and Simmons are his grandparents.**In Episode 14 - <i>The Devil Complex</i>, Fitz says, \"Well, I've temporarily plugged the dam, but it could burst at any minute, releasing more of these anomalies into the base.\" The phrasing implies the temporary plugging was recent.*In Episode 14 - <i>The Devil Complex</i>, snow is shown on the ground, suggesting it is still winter.*In Episode 15 - <i>Rise and Shine</i>, Coulson says to Hale, \"Listen, my team wasn't hiding all these months. We traveled to the future.\" From this, it can be taken that it has only been \"months\" since May 12, 2017, when the agents were sent to the future. While it has to now be 2018, it should not be later than early 2018. As well as this, this piece of dialogue suggests that the amount of time that his team have been back in the present is negligible, because he is generalizing the whole time since May 12, 2017 as the time that they were not around, but in the future.*In <i>[[Missing Pieces]]</i>, Enoch says he was going to protect Fitz for the next \"73 years, 261 days\". The team are in 2091, so if they left the future as early as possible, December 31, 2091, then since Fitz wakes 4 days prior, the latest he can possibly have woken is December 27, 2091. Even if Fitz were to wake as late as possible, the latest this scene could be is then April 10, 2018. Except the scene is implied to after <i>The End</i>, since it should be after the split in the timeline (seemingly not possible to have happened in the original timeline), suggesting <i>The End</i> should be no later than April 10, 2018.*In <i>[[Fear and Loathing on the Planet of Kitson]]</i>, Enoch says he is planning to orbit Jupiter with Fitz for the next \"72 years, 312 days\", which should end before he takes Fitz to the Lighthouse. Fitz wakes no later than December 27, 2091, so the latest <i>Fear and Loathing on the Planet of Kitson</i> could possibly be is February 18, 2019. However, it is 13 months on from <i>The End</i> (Coulson and May \"got more [time] than [they] thought [they] would\", so Coulson lived roughly the \"weeks\" Simmons mentions he might have if he is lucky in <i>The End</i>, and <i>Missing Pieces</i> ends on the 1-year anniversary of Coulson's death, the same day <i>Fear and Loathing on the Planet of Kitson</i> is set - plus it is mentioned that Fitz died \"over a year ago\"), so <i>The End</i> would have to finish in January 2018.*In <i>Spider-Man: Far From Home</i>, Betty Brant says, \"Even though we had blipped away halfway through the school year and had already taken midterms.\" This would make it approximately January/February. There is wiggle room for it to loosely mean \"halfway\", just \"in the bulk of\", \"not at the beginning or end of\", but it should still be no later than May 2018, so it is not in the final several weeks of term. This essentially confirms that Lang did not serve a full 24 months, as <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> cannot be as late as June 2018 following this comment.Furthermore, <i>[[The Punisher]]</i>: [[The Punisher/Season Two|Season 2]], which firmly places itself in April-May 2018 (see other references). Jeph Loeb stated in July 2018, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UqrlizXWIM&t=2015s\">\"The short answer is that the stories that you're seeing, unless otherwise noted, all happen before [...] what is affectionately referred to as \"The Thanos Snap\". And we'll continue to be in that place until we find out what happens in <i>Avengers 4</i>,\"</a> referring to all <i>Marvel Cinematic Universe</i> television released before April 26, 2019. This would place <i>The Punisher</i>: Season 2 (released in January 2019) before <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> (save for the \"three months later\" epilogue of <i>The Whirlwind</i>, which is August 2018, so has to be after <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> no matter what), thereby making <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> set in at least May 2018. However, this is also the only answer Loeb could feasibly give, and he does not explicitly cover every single season, nor specifically <i>The Punisher</i>: Season 2 (saying only that the shows will be set before <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/8pbxyk/im_jeph_loeb_head_of_marvel_tv_ama/e0a5ju5/\">\"for the most part\"</a> on a prior occasion), so it is possible that the one season being set after <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> is not a hard contradiction to Loeb's comments, but April 2018 would be no more than 3 months maximum after Thanos snaps his fingers, and to see no acknowledgement of this in the world so shortly after is highly unlikely. Placing the Snap in May 2018, all pushing and pulling factors considered, makes sense as a compromise anyway, so the Snap should indeed be placed after the main events of <i>The Punisher</i>: Season 2. Thursday, May 17, 2018 would make the most sense (mere hours after the end of the main events), as it is as early as possible, to be as far away as possible from the end of school term in conjunction with the \"halfway\" <i>Spider-Man: Far From Home</i> line.<br>A final complication comes from <i>[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]</i>: [[Jessica Jones (TV series)/Season Three|Season 3]]. Most evidence would place it in November-December 2018, but this would be just about 6 months post-Snap, with zero acknowledgement of such a monumental, worldwide long-lasting trauma effect. Ultimately, the best-fitting placement is April-May 2018 instead (see other references), allowing it to be pre-Snap. However, in that case, the season ends on May 27, 2018, making the earliest the Snap can be Thursday, May 31, 2018. So, using this earliest possible placement (as any later would contradict <i>Spider-Man: Far From Home</i>, and late May is already much closer to the later evidence than the earlier), <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> and its related events can be placed on May 30-31, 2018, with the main events of <i>The Devil Complex</i> to <i>All Roads Lead...</i> therefore being May 17-21, 2018.<br>A laptop early in <i>Ant-Man and the Wasp</i> has the date <a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/caps.pictures/201/7-antman-wasp/full/antman-wasp-movie-screencaps.com-1217.jpg?strip=all\">\"4/30/2018\"</a>. With the idea of Lang's house arrest being 24 months thrown out, so <i>Ant-Man and the Wasp</i>'s placement flexible - and the events of <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> being mid-to-late May 2018, late April-early May 2018 for the main events of <i>Ant-Man and the Wasp</i> would make sense. The main events of <i>Ant-Man and the Wasp</i> begin on a Sunday, with Cassie saying, \"I had a fun weekend.\" Scott has 3 days remaining of his house arrest sentence, and the sentence finishes right after the climax, making that Wednesday. Working back, Scott's dream in the bath is Monday night, meaning the house arrest montage spans Sunday and Monday. April 30, 2018 is a Monday, so this aligns for the main events to be Sunday, April 29, 2018 to Wednesday, May 2, 2018."

    "desc": "Deke Shaw is shot in the arm in Episode 17 - <i>[[The Honeymoon]]</i>, the day before the end of <i>[[All Roads Lead...]]</i>. Following this, he wears a sling until the beginning of Episode 21 - <i>[[The Force of Gravity]]</i>. This should mean that several weeks pass between him being shot and having the sling taken off. However, the only possible gap in time is between <i>All Roads Lead...</i> and <i>Option Two</i>, and the show treats it very much like it has been merely hours when <i>Option Two</i> begins. This would in total mean that Deke had the sling for barely over 1 day, which is impossible. Stretching the gap between <i>All Roads Lead...</i> and <i>Option Two</i>, it really can be no more than about 5 days, considering the agents' actions, discussions, and behavior. However, even if we consider that the surgery on Shaw was very successful and he healed very fast and took off the sling very prematurely - as soon as he could, to help him be more able in the times of crisis that were occurring, it really cannot be shorter than about 2 weeks of recovery time, which would involve a 13-day gap between <i>All Roads Lead...</i> and <i>Option Two</i>. Overall, a 9-day jump is necessary, giving 10 days of recovery time before taking off the sling. It absolutely cannot be any longer, yet it absolutely cannot be shorter. So, with <i>Option Two</i> being the Wednesday of <i>[[Avengers: Infinity War]]</i>, the main events of <i>All Roads Lead...</i> end on the previous week's Monday.<br>Working backwards, <i>All Roads Lead...</i> begins the day before (Sunday), and Episode 16 - <i>[[Inside Voices]]</i> and 17 - <i>The Honeymoon</i> are earlier that Sunday. In <i>Inside Voices</i>, Ruby Hale says, \"Why not talk to Coulson [...] I think after 2 days in isolation,\" which places the \"24 hours ago\" portion of Episode 15 - <i>[[Rise and Shine]]</i> as being 2 days prior, Friday, thus meaning that <i>Rise and Shine</i> spans the Thursday-Saturday almost 2 weeks before <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i>. The exact dates assigned to these days are May 17-21, 2018 (see other references)."
