===January===
====9th====
*''{{WPS|Malibu (album)|Come Down}}'' by {{WPS|Anderson .Paak}} is released.<ref name="IF104">''[[Eight Diagram Dragon Palm|Iron Fist: 1.04: Eight Diagram Dragon Palm]]''</ref><ref name="IF Wikipedia References">''{{WPS|The Art of War}}'', {{WPS|Big Pun}}, {{WPS|Blackalicious}}, {{WPS|Boogie Down Productions}}, ''{{WPS|Crazy in Love}}'', {{WPS|List of iPod models|iPod 1st Generation}}, ''{{WPS|Priesthood (album)|Priesthood}}'', ''{{WPS|So Fresh, So Clean}}'', ''{{WPS|Summertime '06}}'', ''{{WPS|Uptown Saturday Night (album)|Uptown Saturday Night}}'', ''{{WPS|Malibu (album)|Malibu}}''</ref>

====19th====
*[[Joy Meachum]] closes a deal to buy [[Red Hook Pier]], not realizing it is for the purposes of the [[Hand]].<ref name="IF104">''[[Eight Diagram Dragon Palm|Iron Fist: 1.04: Eight Diagram Dragon Palm]]''</ref>

====20th====
*[[Joy Meachum]] and [[Ward Meachum]] record an interview for the [[New York Bulletin]].<ref name="New York Bulletin Meachums">''[[:File:New York Bulletin Joy and Ward Meachum Special Report|New York Bulletin | Joy and Ward Meachum Special Report]]''</ref>

====22nd====
*The Minoru family holds a memorial service for their daughter, [[Amy Minoru]]. All of the members of [[PRIDE]] and all of the people who would call themselves the [[Runaways]] attend, except for [[Alex Wilder]], who is too upset by Amy's [[Assassination of Amy Minoru|apparent suicide]] to enter.<ref>In [[Lord of Lies|''Lord of Lies'']], a flashback to Amy's memorial service is shown as being "Two years ago." Amy's death is dated December 4th, 2015 (see [[2015]] references), and ''Lord of Lies'' is dated to late January of 2018, which makes "Two years ago" late January of 2016, too late for a Christian or American memorial service.

However, the Minoru family is also Japanese, and that culture has different funeral traditions. The traditions varies, including a memorial service every day for several days, a certain number of services within 49 days, and one on the 7th, 49th, and 100th day after death. Whereas the first one doesn't work with "Two years ago," the last one does, since December 4th, 2015 + 49 days = January 22nd, 2016, which is right in the appropriate window for the last tradition.

Thus, it can be concluded that the Minorus are honoring Amy's death using Japanese traditions, and this memorial service is the last one within a 49-day period, which is implied by Alex not wanting to say his "last goodbye," implying that this is the final one.

====25th====
*[[Frank Castle]] plays the guitar, remembering how he used to teach his daughter [[Lisa Castle|Lisa]].<ref name="TP1 January-May Placement">In ''[[3 AM]]'', a montage is shown of what Frank Castle does following ''[[A Cold Day in Hell's Kitchen]]'', consisting of him playing guitar, his attack in Alabama, his attack in Juárez, and finally his last attack in JFK airport, followed by him retiring the "Punisher" role. In the airport scene, O'Hare's ticket seemingly says "April", and what appears to be the next day is when Frank retires, before cutting to "Six months later", to a scene firmly placed on November 6, 2016. This would imply that the retirement scene is May 2016. With the day before seemingly being April, it can be taken that the attack in the airport is April 30, 2016, and his retirement being May 1st. The other three previous scenes in the montage are distributed evenly between December 24, 2015 and April 30, 2016.</ref><ref name="TP101"/>

Malick then uses his collected fragments of the [[Monolith]] to reopen the portal. Ward, Fitz, and several HYDRA agents proceed to go through. As Coulson flies in above, he realizes that he has run out of time, so he dives from the [[Quinjet]] into the castle, falling through the portal from above just before it closes. He crashes onto the ground of Maveth and is knocked out on impact.<ref name="AoS309"/>
*A physical rehabilitation instructor from [[Metro-General Hospital]], who had worked with [[Jonathan Pangborn]] a couple of years prior, encounters Pangborn walking on the streets.

**[[File:LincolnCampbell-comforts-Joey.jpg|thumb|250px|Campbell comforts Gutierrez before the assault on the HYDRA Castle]]May, Johnson, Campbell, and Gutierrez slip into nearby drainage tunnels and approach the HYDRA Castle. Campbell takes out the lighting while the team slip inside.<ref name="AoS310"/>
**Meanwhile, Simmons escapes and runs around the compound. She discovers the Inhuman storage units and finds [[Andrew Garner]]'s pod. He convinces her to set him free so he can help her to escape HYDRA, and transforms into Lash, saving her and escaping.<ref name="AoS310"/><ref name="AoS3 Garner's Beard">[[Andrew Garner]]'s beard in ''[[Maveth (episode)|Maveth]]'' seems to indicate that he has been under [[HYDRA]] custody for around a month, depending on how fast his beard grows. The timeline works out as December 13, 2015 to January 31, 2016, which works sufficiently.</ref>

**Coulson and Ward eventually spot Daniels and Fitz and hurry to reach them in time. As they walk, Daniels tells him of an ancient civilization on Maveth. Fitz realizes that it is not [[Will Daniels]] but [[Hive|It]], who has taken over Daniels' dead body.<ref name="AoS310"/>
**The Zephyr One hovers above the HYDRA castle, ready to bomb the [[HYDRA Castle]] as soon as the portal closes. Johnson collapses.<ref name="AoS310"/>
*'''[[Battle of Maveth]]''':

Coulson manages to beat Ward down due to his bound hands. Fitz grabs a flare gun and shoots It, burning Daniels' body. Despite Fitz's advice to leave, Coulson uses his [[Phil Coulson's Prosthetic Hand|bionic hand]] to crush Ward's chest, killing him and finally enacting his revenge. Coulson drops the hand, leaving it behind to signify leaving his actions on the planet.<ref name="AoS310"/><ref name="AoS4 BOOM Ward Last Year">In ''[[BOOM]]'', [[Phil Coulson]] says, "I've followed my worst instincts at times. Last year. Loss will make you do that. It feels good in the moment, but it never ends well. I've lost my temper. I've killed." He is referring to murdering Ward, and refers to it as "last year". He says this on April 27, 2017, referring to January 31, 2016, which fits the statement.</ref><ref name="AoS3 Mid-Season Break"/>
**[[File:HYDRA-Castle-Destroyed.jpg|thumb|250px|The HYDRA Castle is destroyed]]Coulson and Fitz make it through the portal and onto a [[Containment Module]] with Mackenzie and Johnson, and Mackenzie orders May to bomb the castle.

*[[File:DS Spot 20 - 1.png|thumb|255px|Strange performs the surgery]][[Stephen Strange]] realizes that a patient has been prematurely pronounced dead, and rushes the man to an operating theatre.<ref name="DS October 2015-January 2017 Placement">[https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/empire-podcast-doctor-strange-spoiler-special-scott-derrickson/ Scott Derrickson said, "It's months that he's in recovery, I think it's between 3 and 6 months. Yeah, I think it's about 3 to 6 months. Somewhere in there <nowiki>[...]</nowiki> I think - gosh, don't hold me to this because again I haven't thought about this in a long time <nowiki>[...]</nowiki> but I think it's about a year from the beginning of the movie to his return to New York. And so, <nowiki>[...]</nowiki> I think it starts early fall, to late fall, so it's a little over a year, because I think it's like winter-y when he has the fight with Christine, it's like that cold, New York, really dark grey, nearly snowing kind of vibe."]<br>On the day of Strange's car crash, he checks his watch and [[:File:DS Promo Clip - The Multiverse 7.png|it says "TUE", "2016", "FEB", "2"]], making it Tuesday, February 2, 2016. While this does not fit with the fact that ''WHiH World News'' [https://twitter.com/WHIHOfficial/status/727256906952138753 tweeted on May 2, 2016] and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgGY_snj-I posted a video on May 3, 2016] (and ''WHiH World News'' is proven to be set in real time, ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkZwlIYLNBQ 1], [https://twitter.com/WHIHOfficial/status/616657863876956160 2], [https://twitter.com/WHIHOfficial/status/617408255283884032 3], [https://twitter.com/WHIHOfficial/status/723617629328416768 4], and other dialogue in videos matching with dates given)) about Strange being a surgeon, Scott Derrickson [https://twitter.com/scottderrickson/status/959550885075468288 tweeted to confirm the February 2nd date] as well as retweeting another post about it.<br>With the beginning of the film in "early fall" and the end of the film in "late fall", "a little over a year" later, and the February 2016 car crash falling between the two, this would mean the film begins around early Fall 2015 and ends around late Fall 2016. However, Derrickson also says that Strange recovers for 3-6 months, and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYxmUMCNxCo Mads Mikkelsen says Strange trains for "9 months" before his clash with Kaecilius], which overall would suggest the film ends 12-15 months after Strange's car crash, thus placing the ending around February-May 2017. This, in turn, using Derrickson's comment about "a little over a year" ("early" one season to  "late" the same season a year later would mean 4⅔ seasons, so about 14 months), would, working backwards, place the opening of the film between December 2015 and February 2016 (the latest it can be, before Strange's car crash).<br>Overall, using weighted math from all the evidence available, the details of which can be seen [[User:Marvelus/Phase Three Timeline#Doctor Strange|here]], the result is that the opening is October 13, 2015, the car crash February 2, 2016, the argument with Christine March 29, 2016, Strange's arrival in Kathmandu May 4, 2016, and the climax January 18-19, 2017.<br>This would put the opening still in the early part of fall (working with Derrickson's comment), the argument with Christine towards the end of the snowy period and a bit after winter, but enough time after Strange's crash and a good time for the heavy rain (a bit later than Derrickson's comment but realistic), his arrival in Kathmandu 3 months after his crash (just fitting inside Derrickson's 3-6 months comment), the climax another 8.5 months later (just fitting for Mikkelsen's "9 months" comment), and the climax a bit after Fall 2016, instead Winter 2016-17 (a bit later than Derrickson's comment) but fitting as "a little over a year" (15 months) after the opening (fitting reasonably with Derrickson's comment), a realistic time of year for the snowfall at the Ancient One's death, and working with the other comments just described. This also works fine considering Derrickson made it clear he did not want to be fully held to his comments.<br>The specific dates of smaller events in between can also be found [[User:Marvelus/Phase Three Timeline#Filling in the Gaps|here]].</ref><ref name="DS"/>

The receptionist calls security, but he manages to defeat them and use the elevator to go to the floor where his father's office was.<ref name="IF1 Placement">''[[Iron Fist (TV series)|Iron Fist]]'': [[Iron Fist (TV series)/Season One|Season 1]] takes place a while after ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'': [[Daredevil (TV series)/Season Two|Season 2]] and ''[[Luke Cage (TV series)|Luke Cage]]'': [[Luke Cage (TV series)/Season One|Season 1]] in late 2015. The exact dates for its placement are contradictory.
<br>A few pieces of evidence, from small dates on screens and a newspaper saying Danny is "25", not 24, overall suggest that the season is set around mid-2016. However, a Chinese festival appearing in ''Snow Gives Way'' includes lion and dragon dances and the zodiac monkey mask (2016 was indeed the Year of the Monkey), all heavily suggesting that the festival is Chinese New Year. This lines up with the other, broader evidence.
<br>Charlie Cox is quoted as saying ''The Defenders'': Season 1 is 6 months after ''Daredevil'': Season 2 ([http://www.cinemablend.com/television/1685619/why-matt-murdock-doesnt-want-to-be-daredevil-anymore-when-the-defenders-begins 1], [http://comicbook.com/marvel/2017/07/31/daredevil-season-2-charlie-cox-missing-scene/ 2]), which would place that season around May/June 2016, and the overall result of Finn Jones and Jessica Henwick's comments about the time between ''[[Dragon Plays with Fire]]'' and ''[[The Defenders]]'': [[The Defenders/Season One|Season 1]] suggested a little over 2 months' span ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obGSvaYP1VA "several months"], [http://screenrant.com/defenders-colleen-wing-jessica-henwick-story/ "1 month"], [https://www.pressreader.com/uk/empire-uk/20170801/282510068602588 "about 2 months"], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kdq7xbftTbs "a couple of months"]), which, working back, would indeed line up with ''Dragon Plays with Fire'' ending in March 2016. ''[[Worst Behavior]]'' also shows that by ''The Defenders'': Season 1, Elektra's resurrection (December 25, 2015) was "months ago", and it is said in the season that Danny leaving for K'un-Lun/starting to go after the Hand were both also "months" prior. The fact that the same timespan is given since both ''[[A Cold Day in Hell's Kitchen]]'' and ''[[Dragon Plays with Fire]]'' would suggest that the events are close together, within 2-3 months of each other, certainly not 7 months apart.
<br>Using Chinese New Year, which lines up with this more important evidence, the season revolves around February 8, 2016 (Chinese New Year 2016).</ref><ref name="IF101"/>

When Meachum finds him there, she threatens him, saying that she will ensure that he is arrested. Rand tries to convince her again that he is who he says he is, but she does not believe him.

This is impossible, with the timezones being 13 hours apart and daylight hours not lining up. However, with some stretching to be as close as possible, it works out as such:
<br>On the 20th, around 15:45 New York time/21st, 04:45 local time, the trio land in China and make their way to Anzhou, getting there around morning local time. Several hours later, roughly 03:00 New York time/16:00 local time, they discuss Colleen's mother at Anzhou. Danny says, "We saw some workers being herded in a few hours ago," implying they have been in Anzhou for more than a few hours, and a few hours ago the compound was still visible in daylight. Joy and Ward then talk by the river in the very early morning in New York, when really it should still be just before sunrise. Then, in Anzhou, Danny says, "They leave for their evening meal around now, right?", meaning it is evening local time, just still daytime (really, the sun should have just set). Ward takes Joy to the Art Deco building, still in the very early morning, and Danny takes Gao, before they return to the plane, and would arrive back in New York around midnight on the night of the 21st-22nd.</ref><ref name="IF108"/>

**[[File:IF vs Elektra.JPG|thumb|250px|Danny Rand fights Elektra]]They are unable to save Shaft from being fatally wounded.<ref name="TD1 Placement">''[[The Defenders]]'': [[The Defenders/Season One|Season 1]] is set after the events of ''[[Iron Fist (TV series)|Iron Fist]]'': [[Iron Fist (TV series)/Season One|Season 1]], and [https://www.bustle.com/p/when-does-the-punisher-take-place-the-defenders-left-some-chaos-in-its-wake-5469226 before ''The Punisher'': Season 1], as they were chronologically released. There is a tiny, unfocused laptop date of "11/07/2016" in ''[[The H Word]]'', which is most likely simply the date of filming. This is overruled by the fact that if the season began on November 6th, it would run in November to the point where it clashes with hard dates stated in ''The Punisher'': Season 1 - with Karen Page being in two places at once. It is also overruled by evidence for it being earlier in the year:
<br>Charlie Cox was quoted as saying, [http://ew.com/tv/2017/01/13/defenders-charlie-cox-daredevil-interview/ "Well, it's been a few months since the end of Season 2. I think it's been quite a challenging few months for him."] This would place the season only a few months after November/December 2015 (depending on whether he is referring to the climax or the epilogue), when ''Daredevil'': Season 2 comes to an end. He later stated, [http://www.cinemablend.com/television/1685619/why-matt-murdock-doesnt-want-to-be-daredevil-anymore-when-the-defenders-begins "At the end of ''Daredevil'' Season 2, everyone failed. Matt failed, and the consequences were devastating. Six or so months have passed, and he's had to completely reevaluate everything that he believes, everything that he does."] Six months would place ''The Defenders'': Season 1 around May/June 2016. He added later, [http://comicbook.com/marvel/2017/07/31/daredevil-season-2-charlie-cox-missing-scene/ "In the 6 months since ''Daredevil'' ended and this show begins, there is so much stuff that I would like to have explored,"] again placing it in May/June. It is confirmed in the show that it has been months since the epilogue of ''Daredevil'': Season 2, with it flashing back to its events, "Months ago..."
<br>Finn Jones and Jessica Henwick provided some slightly contradictory information about the amount of time it has been since ''Iron Fist'': Season 1. Henwick said, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obGSvaYP1VA "It takes place several months after ''Iron Fist''..."] She later said, [http://screenrant.com/defenders-colleen-wing-jessica-henwick-story/ "We pick up with Colleen not in New York - which is crazy, as all the shows have been predominantly in New York. We find her a month after we left her,"] and, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kdq7xbftTbs "We pick up, I would say a couple months after we left."] Finn Jones stated in [https://www.pressreader.com/uk/empire-uk/20170801/282510068602588 ''Empire'' magazine, "It's about two months after ''Iron Fist'' finishes."] Overall, it can be taken that it is about 2-2½ months. ''Iron Fist'': Season 1 finishes on March 1, 2016, and so this would suggest it is around May 2016. In ''[[The H Word]]'', Danny says, "We've been chasing the Hand for months," referring to the time since March 1st. In ''[[Worst Behavior]]'', Alexandra says, "Danny Rand has been running around off the grid for months," referring to the time since he left on February 27th.
<br>These timespans would suggest around late May 2016. However, in ''[[Ashes, Ashes]]'', it is shown that there are a few small lumps of snow leftover from a reasonably recent snowfall. This would place it earlier in the year. We know from ''[[Self Control]]'', which is firmly no earlier than late April 2017, that it is perhaps a little more commong for there to be snowfall in late April in the ''MCU'' than the real world, so it is just about possible that there was an April snowfall, and it is now early May. There is also a calendar in the precinct through the season, which is a Sunday-Saturday calendar (as the same type is shown up close in ''[[A Cold Day in Hell's Kitchen]]''), where the days matching the dates, and the fact it has 31 days, would mean it is a March 2016 calendar. We know from ''A Cold Day in Hell's Kitchen'' that the precinct calendars can fall behind a couple of months (as in that episode, between scenes, it is flipped from September 2015 to December).
<br>Overall, it can be taken that the season takes place around early May 2016, after Lagos. This is 6 months after Elektra's death in the climax of ''Daredevil'': Season 2, as Cox stated, and a couple of months after ''Iron Fist'': Season 1's ending, as Henwick and Jones have implied, and as the show states. There was a late snowfall in April, and there is a little compacted snow left, and the calendar is a little behind. This also fits with the feel and dialogue implications of the timespan since ''Luke Cage'': Season 1, minimising the gap between ''Jessica Jones'': Season 1 and the season (which is implied to be recent), and allowing Karen 6 months to have moved past her mourning for Matt by the time she appears in ''The Punisher'': Season 1.
<br>On Day 3 and Day 8 of the season, Trish Talk appears, which is reaffirmed in the season to be a weekday show. This means they are either Wednesday 4th and Monday 9th, Thursday 5th and Tuesday 10th, or Friday 6th and Wednesday 11th. If it is the Friday and Wednesday, this allows the New York parts to begin 2 days after Lagos, allowing it to not be top news, but also adding an extra reason why, on Day 3, Trish Talk listeners are concerned about terrorist attacks because of recent events. This also fits with the Trish Talk team going to lunch on Day 5, the 8th, as it would be a Sunday and so they are not on air.
<br>Therefore, the season takes place approximately from May 4-14, 2016.</ref><ref name="TD101"/>

*Zhang and his chefs watch behind the counter as Stick approaches the group, and Murdock warns the others that Stick will only be planning to use them for his own ends. Stick explains that he was a part of the [[Chaste]] and was trained by similar masters as the ones who trained Rand in [[K'un-Lun]]. Murdock pushes Stick aside to speak privately, to Cage's displeasure. Murdock states that people will die.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD104"/>
*In grand disbelief of the conversation, Jones decides she is going to leave.

*Preparing for a meeting, [[Alexandra Reid]] takes her prescribed pills. She takes a deep breath, then makes a call to say that her plans for the evening have changed.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD104"/>
*In her apartment, Jones drinks her liquor and looks through her photographs of the signed documents taken earlier that day. As she begins deleting them, she notices the handwriting of the signatures are all very similar, concluding that the individuals from across the centuries were, somehow, the [[Alexandra Reid|same person]]. Jones reconsiders the truth to Stick's stories.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD104"/>
*As Stick informs the remaining trio about the five Fingers of the Hand, including [[Bakuto]], Rand comments that he killed him some time ago. Stick also discloses that another, [[Murakami]], is the one who pulled the strings around he and Murdock's former enemy, [[Nobu Yoshioka]]. Eventually, Murdock becomes impatient with his former teacher and asks what he desires; Rand interjects, stating Stick has just told him more than the elders of [[K'un-Lun]] ever did. Murdock and Rand briefly become hostile before Murdock walks away from the table, tired of the Hand situation.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD104"/>
*Jones wakes [[Michelle Raymond]] at her [[Raymond Residence|house]]. Mildly drunk, she informs Raymond that digging deeper into her [[John Raymond|husband]]'s case has proven it to be weirder and weirder, and says that she will try to provide round-the-clock security for them. When Raymond tells Jones that she believed she already had security due to the car outside her house, Jones warns her to lock the doors and windows and go to [[Lexi Raymond|her daughter]] while she goes to confront the man in the car.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD104"/>
*Rand continues to eat, and Cage questions how he could still be eating. Stating that it helps to restore his chi, Rand then comments that the two of them could make a great team, much to Cage's dissatisfaction.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD104"/>
*Stick approaches Murdock and questions him on his encounter with Natchios. Though Murdock expresses optimism about her resurrection, Stick warns him that she is only a "vessel", and not the same person he fell in love with before. Suddenly, both blind men hear weapons nearby.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD104"/>
*[[Jessica Jones]] goes to the parked SUV by the [[Raymond Residence]] and grabs the Hand henchman who was ordered to spy on the Raymonds, pulling him out of the car. The two briefly fight until he is pinned down. Jones pushes for him to leave the Raymonds alone, as they knew nothing about John's work. When the man refuses to go, however, Jones pressures him against the windshield until he finally leaves.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD104"/>
*Just as [[Matt Murdock]], [[Danny Rand]], and [[Luke Cage]] prepare themselves to fight the [[Hand]] soldiers approaching the [[Royal Dragon]], [[Stick]] senses that [[Alexandra Reid]] has entered from the back. As they turn to her, she approaches Rand with the offer to join her side. Though Cage and Stick warn Rand not to go with her, Reid continues to push.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD104"/>
*'''[[Ambush at the Royal Dragon]]''':
**When Rand declines her offer, Reid sends in the [[Elektra|Black Sky]], who slashes the door hinges and breaks into the restaurant.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD104"/>
**At that moment, an SUV comes crashing into the restaurant and knocks Natchios to the ground. Jessica Jones emerges, having pushed the henchman from the Raymond Residence's car through the window. She rejoins her friends, and they prepare to fight the Hand together.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD104"/>
**[[Danny Rand]] and [[Matt Murdock]] engage [[Murakami]] in battle, who entered the restaurant from the rooftop. [[Jessica Jones]] and [[Luke Cage]] try to take down Natchios as [[Alexandra Reid]] stays in the back, before leaving through a back door. Though Rand and Murdock manage to knock Murakami off his feet, he soon gets up to retreat.<ref name="TD105"/>
**The vigilantes notice that Reid has left, but have no time to act before [[Sowande]]'s men, carrying firearms, begin firing throughout the restaurant. Everyone except Cage takes cover from the spray bullets, but [[Madame Gao]] pulls a pistol of her own and kills one of Sowande's henchman, reminding Sowande that they are required to capture the Iron Fist alive, and his actions are reckless.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD105"/>
**Alongside [[Stick]], the group is suddenly circled by the Hand's fighters. The five initiate a brawl with every [[Hand]] soldier and Murdock disarms Natchios, taking her out of the restaurant. He declares that he will not fight her and attempts to make Natchios remember him. At the mention of her name, Natchios calms down, allowing Murdock to slowly approach her and ask what the Hand have done to her.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD105"/> 
**Murakami interrupts the ex-lovers and orders Natchios to kill Murdock. She is hesitant to obey, and so Murakami tries to attack Murdock himself; however, Natchios suddenly intervenes, protecting her old love as she beats Murakami and leaves him unconscious, before vanishing.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD105"/>
**In the meantime, [[Sowande]] manages to lure [[Luke Cage]] outside of the Royal Dragon, convinced that he will be able to break Cage. After a few strikes, Cage is beaten into the street. He is soon hit by a truck driven by the Hand.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD105"/>
**Jones watches in horror as Cage is dragged away, just as several more [[Hand]] soldiers arrive at the scene. Rand overpowers the soldiers inside, but upon going after Gao, the woman pushes him backwards with force and leaves him stunned. Gao then orders her henchmen to restrain him.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD105"/>
**The henchmen are, however, interrupted by the arrival of Stick and [[Jessica Jones]], who defeat Gao's henchmen and leave with Rand through the back exit. Without Cage, the remaining four reassemble and escape through the sewers.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD105"/>
**[[Madame Gao]] walks to the back and uses her powers to blast the door to where the group had been hiding; however, she finds the area empty. Murakami is approached by Gao. She questions him on the whereabouts of the vigilantes and the [[Elektra|Black Sky]], and he replies that she should instead ask Alexandra Reid for Natchios' whereabouts.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD105"/>
*The group heads back to the [[Chikara Dojo]], where they are received by [[Colleen Wing]], who had been worried about the situation. Murdock senses that someone is coming, but calms down when he realizes that it is [[Luke Cage]], who has captured [[Sowande]] and returned to the team.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD105"/>
*In her penthouse, [[Alexandra Reid]] visits [[Elektra Natchios]]. She tells Natchios the story of her previous life, how she had once a daughter who had eventually died, and how she enlisted into the [[Order of the Crane Mother]] from [[K'un-Lun]]. She then informs Natchios that if she is unable to kill those she is tasked to kill, she will be useless to the [[Hand]]. They are interrupted by Murakami, who enters and asks to speak with Reid himself.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD105"/>
*In the very early hours of the morning, Murdock, Cage, Rand, Jones, and [[Stick]] head to an abandoned building where they tie [[Sowande]] to a chair. They interrogate him on the Hand's current operations in the [[New York City|city]]. Instead of giving up information, Sowande warns them that their efforts to stop the Hand are futile, mentioning that they have plans to harm the group's loved ones, such as the "[[Claire Temple|nurse]]" and the "[[Trish Walker|radio host]]". Jones punches Sowande in anger and leaves him unconscious.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD105"/>
*While Stick stays to watch over their hostage, Cage wakes [[Claire Temple]] at her mother's [[Soledad Temple's Apartment|apartment]], informing her that the Hand may target her.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD105"/>

*Wing and Rand hear someone approaching. They leave to investigate, but Wing is soon ambushed by [[Bakuto]], revealing himself to have been revived after the [[Duel at Bethesda Terrace]]. Wing tries to attack her former sensei, but he subdues her with ease. She is saved by [[Luke Cage]], who arrives in time to knock Bakuto aside as Rand and Temple arrive. Bakuto disappears, but not before threatening the Iron Fist.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD105"/>
*[[Matt Murdock]] manages to find [[Karen Page]] at her office and briefly informs her on the situation. She becomes angry at him for returning to vigilantism.

*Sowande awakens and is confronted by [[Stick]]. Sowande decides to try to get inside Stick's mind, telling him the story of how the [[Chaste]] once captured him, just as Stick has now, and that he will soon be free of the chair. He tells Stick that not even the vigilantes will be able to help him defeat the [[Hand]]. Despite Sowande's threats, Stick ignores him.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD105">''[[Take Shelter|The Defenders: 1.05: Take Shelter]]''</ref>

====8th====
*[[Matt Murdock]] returns to their hideout and talks to [[Stick]], who claims that he had been trying to protect Murdock from his two worlds colliding. Murdock says that he does not buy it - that this was merely Stick's latest attempt to manipulate him into joining the [[Chaste]] and the war which he had no desire to be a part of.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD105"/>
*Stick tells Murdock to lead his [[Defenders|new group of vigilantes]], claiming that his leadership is needed as the [[Iron Fist]] is not suitable. Murdock explains that he has no desire to lead anybody into any kind of fight, to which Stick notes that he should have more faith in God's plan for him. This annoys Murdock, considering Stick to be using his faith against him. [[Stick]] reminds him of his duty to protect [[New York City]] and Murdock becomes angry, eventually leaving, telling Stick that he already knew who he was and did not need Stick's reminders.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD105"/>
*'''[[Rescue of Trish Walker]]''':
**[[Jessica Jones]] tries to locate [[Trish Walker]], so as to get her to safety. She finds her adoptive sister discussing the future of [[Trish Talk|her talk show]] with her producers, and Jones tells her they have to go.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD105"/>
**As the women leave, they are ambushed by [[Murakami]]. He easily subdues Jones and moves to kill her, just as [[Daredevil]] arrives to help. Together, Jones and Murdock defeat Murakami, who decides to flee.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD105"/>
*Walker and [[Malcolm Ducasse]] are taken to the [[29th Precinct Police Station]] under the surveillance of [[Misty Knight]]. Ducasse and Walker meet [[Karen Page]] and [[Foggy Nelson]], who have also just arrived at the precinct.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD105"/>
*The four free fingers of the [[Hand]] reconvene to discuss their new [[Defenders|enemies]] and how best to deal with them.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD105"/>
*Daredevil, [[Iron Fist]], [[Luke Cage]], and Jessica Jones meet with [[Stick]] to continue to interrogate [[Sowande]]. Daredevil wraps his [[Daredevil's Billy Club|billy club]] around Sowande's neck and constricts to torture him for information, but the man still refuses to reveal any kind of information, beginning to mock Daredevil. In anger, Murdock chokes him and leaves him unconscious. Stick advises Murdock to tell the truth to the others about Natchios.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD105"/>
*Meanwhile, [[Murakami]] reveals to the Hand that Rand has found a new ally in the Devil of Hell's Kitchen. This is questioned by [[Madame Gao]], asking him if he was sure, since the Daredevil had been absent from [[New York City]] for months. Murakami insists it was true, noting that he saw him with his own eyes.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD105"/>
*[[Bakuto]] notes that while Daredevil is a formidable fighter, so are the four of them. However, Murakami explains that his concern was not combat skill, but Daredevil's apparent relationship with [[Elektra Natchios]], their Black Sky, with Gao noting that they had [[Attack on the Hand|fought side-by-side]] against [[Nobu Yoshioka]] before his death. Murakami reminds them that Natchios had loved Daredevil, and claims that this was the reason she had attacked him instead of Daredevil during the [[Ambush at the Royal Dragon]].<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD105"/>
*[[Alexandra Reid]] questions if Murakami believes that Natchios had failed them, but he claims this was not the case. However, he explains that he believes that Reid herself has failed them, openly questioning her leadership.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD105"/>
*Murdock opens up to the team about his past with Natchios. They argue with him, claiming that he should have told them from the beginning, and during the conflict between Cage and Murdock, [[Sowande]] wakes up and grabs [[Danny Rand]], holding him hostage at knife point. Sowande reveals that now that they have the Iron Fist, they can complete their goal, but [[Stick]] makes a sudden move, beheading him before he can escape with Rand.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD105"/>
*[[Elektra Natchios]] goes to [[Matt Murdock's Apartment]], with the room bringing back memories. Eventually, Natchios enters the bedroom, setting her blade down on a nightstand and lying to rest in the bed.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD105"/>
*Meanwhile, the group converse over [[Sowande]]'s final words, and how the [[Hand]] wishes to bring the [[Iron Fist]] to their side. [[Jessica Jones]], [[Luke Cage]], and [[Matt Murdock]] agree that keeping Rand hidden away is the best decision, but Rand protests that this is what the Hand wants: to divide them. The tension rises and a duel begins between Iron Fist and Daredevil. Cage and Jones try to separate them, but fail. Eventually, Jones manages to knock Rand unconscious, and they tie him to a chair.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD106"/>
*[[Elektra Natchios]] finds Murdock's original [[Daredevil's Suit|Daredevil suit]], a Braille Bible, and a bookmark with the Bible verse of ''Relevation 21:4'', used at her funeral 5 months ago. She takes this with her before leaving the apartment.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD106"/>
*[[Stick]] talks to the others about what their next move should be, noting that [[Midland Circle]] is the Hand's current headquarters. Matt Murdock explains to everyone that he had been there the year before with Natchios while the building was being constructed, and had found a large hole in the centre of the construction. This new revelation causes more of a rift with Jones and Cage, as they accuse him of keeping vital information from them yet again. Stick recommends that they focus on the mission.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD106"/>
*Murdock and Jones head out to see if they can find anything more of what [[John Raymond]] knew about Midland Circle.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD106"/>
*Stick remains behind with Luke Cage and they examine Sowande's dead body. Stick talks about the sleepless nights he had experienced as a result of hunting down and killing the Hand, then promises Cage that he will get rid of Sowande's corpse. When Cage questions what exactly he will do, considering they are dealing with a homicide, Stick refuses to tell him, claiming that the less Cage knows, the better. Cage reluctantly agrees and leaves Stick to act however he feels is necessary.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD106"/>
*Unbeknownst to Cage, Stick puts Sowande's head in a package and intentionally hides it in a place where the [[Hand]] will find it.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD106"/>
*Reid is informed that Sowande's severed head has been found in one of their warehouses. She gathers the other Hand leaders to see, and notes that Stick is the one to blame for killing their colleague. Although both [[Madame Gao]] and [[Bakuto]] claim that Sowande's death could have been avoided if they had searched for him, Reid insists that he only had himself to blame for getting captured, and shows no remorse.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD106"/>
*Reid points out that their many years together have rarely been peaceful and that they have all survived several assassination attempts against each other. She suggests they show unity, but [[Murakami]] retort that they had, in fact, been unified, until she brought the [[Elektra|Black Sky]] into their organization. When Bakuto demands to know where Natchios is, Reid claims that she was being kept hidden, having foreseen that one of them would try to kill her. Gao stands up for Reid, claiming that they must honor Sowande by continuing their mission and following their leader.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD106"/>
*[[Jessica Jones]] and [[Matt Murdock]] arrive at the [[Raymond Residence|Raymonds' residence]] to talk to [[Lexi Raymond]].<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD106"/>
*While taking her pills, [[Alexandra Reid]] is visited by Madame Gao. Gao notes that while Reid's position as leader of the Hand is one of great power, she understands that it also comes with a great burden, and that this is why she had defended her to the others and convinced them to follow her leadership. However, she insists on a single term: that they would find the [[Iron Fist]] without the interference of the Black Sky, whom they have all lost confidence in.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD106"/>
*Reid accuses Gao of losing her faith, but Gao retorts that it was unlike Reid to show such weakness as she does with Natchios, revealing that she believes the same as their fellow leaders. Gao explains that since bringing [[Elektra Natchios]] back with the [[Resurrection Elixir]], they have still come no closer to finding the Iron Fist or returning to K'un-Lun as they had planned, and are merely drawing closer to their own deaths.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD106">''[[Ashes, Ashes|The Defenders: 1.06: Ashes, Ashes]]''</ref>
*Reid tries to argue that Natchios had more than strength of body, but also strength of mind, although Gao notes that the others would still not accept this. When Reid questions why she no longer has faith that the Black Sky will be enough to save them, Gao claims that she simply no longer believes in anything. She leaves Reid to speak with [[Murakami]] and [[Bakuto]] about their decision.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD106"/>
*Meanwhile, in the hideout where Rand is being kept, [[Luke Cage]] reads the ''New York Bulletin'' and its "''Tremors Rock New York''" article about the earthquake. [[Danny Rand]] wakes up and tries to summon his [[Chi]] to free himself. When he sees Cage, they begin to talk. Cage remains by Rand's side but refuses to set him free, while trying to calm him down.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD106"/>
*[[Elektra Natchios]] goes to visit her grave. She is approached by Reid, who explains to her that the woman who had died in December was not truly her. She claims that [[Daredevil]] allowed Natchios to die during her fight against [[Nobu Yoshioka]], and tells her that he may attempt to deceive her again, in an attempt to turn her away from the Hand. Natchios vows that she would not allow that to happen. Reid then reveals to Natchios that she is dying, much to Natchios' shock as she believed the [[Hand]] could live forever. Reid then notes that without the Resurrection Elixir that they gained from the bones of [[dragons]], her body was beginning to shut down, revealing that she had used the last of the Elixir to bring Natchios back to life. With Natchios seemingly devoted to finding the bones for her so as to keep them both alive, Reid then tells her that she is the Black Sky and vows to her that once this is over, they will together be able to serve life itself.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD106"/>
*Through their talk with the Raymonds, Jones and Murdock learn that [[John Raymond|John]] tended to play the piano, beginning after he built the [[Midland Circle Financial]] Building. This leads Murdock to investigate the piano, discovering that John had hidden building plans in the instrument's casing. From these plans, he and Jones learn about a massive cave beneath the structure, and that John intended to level the building to collapse it into the cave and fill the hole. Murdock and Jones head back to the hideout to pass on their findings.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD106"/>
*'''[[Kidnapping of Iron Fist]]''': At the hideout, Stick uses poisoned smoke to render Luke Cage unconscious and prevent [[Danny Rand]] from summoning his Chi, deciding to kill Rand and ensure that the Hand are prevented from using him. However, as he moves to do so, Stick is attacked by [[Elektra Natchios]], who kills her old mentor. Murdock arrives and is horrified at Stick's death. He tries to fight her, but Natchios defeats him, Jones, and a recently awakened Cage, leaving them unconscious and taking the Iron Fist with her.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD106"/>
*Murakami visits [[Alexandra Reid]] At [[Kadir]]'s restaurant, bringing a bottle of extremely rare champagne on the pretence of making peace with her for everything that had been said in the wake of Sowande's death. He tells her that he did not want to leave [[K'un-Lun]] with her,  instead wanting to use their Chi abilities to do good, but Reid is not surprised by this, noting that his greatest strength was his singular focus. Murakami then says that he brought the champagne because he wanted Reid's last meal to be a good one, revealing his intention to kill her and take her place as the Hand's new leader. Remaining confident, Reid mocks Murakami, calling him a foolish for having planned to attack her alone. Before they can engage in a fight, they are interrupted by the arrival of [[Elektra Natchios]], bringing them an unconscious Danny Rand. Reid claims that if Murakami had paid attention, he would have know that she always wins, and never wavered in his faith.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD106"/>
[[File:Alexandradeath.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Alexandra Reid]] being murdered by [[Elektra]]]]
*'''[[Assassination of Alexandra Reid]]''': [[Alexandra Reid]] gloats to the other leaders of the Hand about the victory they have achieved, claiming to have proven herself to be the worthy leader of their organization. As she speaks, she is caught off-guard by Natchios, who surprises her by stabbing her with a sai from behind, deciding to take the opportunity to kill the woman who manipulated her. Reid falls down, dead, and as [[Bakuto]], [[Madame Gao]], and [[Murakami]] stand in shock, Natchios claims the leadership of the Hand for herself.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD106"/>

**Meanwhile, above ground, Bakuto manages to defeat Wing and sets off the explosives' detonator timer. As he bears down on Wing, Knight arrives and attacks him. He knocks her gun aside and hits her with the hilt of his sword, leaving her unable to move. Wing reengages him in the sword fight and [[Claire Temple]] moves around the side in an attempt to ambush him. However, as she attacks, he easily stops her and prepares to kill her as Wing watches, helpless on the ground. Before he can act, Knight steps back in to get in his way, and in the process, he slices off her right arm. Taking advantage of the distraction, however, Wing manages to behead Bakuto, killing him permanently.<ref name="TD1 Placement"/><ref name="TD108"/>

First, Jessica Jones visits Trish Walker at work. This is likely 2 days later, May 11, 2016. Next, Foggy Nelson talks to Luke Cage and Claire Temple. Nelson is composed enough to discuss legal stuff with Cage and Temple, suggesting it's been several days since Murdock's death - at least 4, which would make it at least May 13, 2016. However, 2 scenes later is Jones talking to Cage, and she says that "it's been a hell of a week". The main events for her began on May 4, 2016, suggesting this is May 11, 2016. To compromise, both scenes (and the scene in between with Misty in hospital) are May 12, 2016. This gives 3 days for Nelson to recover a little, and means that Jones is only slightly rounding when she says "a week", since it has been 8 days. The next scene with Rand and Wing is also that day. Then, at Matt Murdock's memorial service, Foggy Nelson says "it's been days" since Murdock's apparent death. It is placed as the day after the last 4 scenes, May 13, 2016, 4 days since Murdock's death.</ref><ref name="TD108"/>

*Cage finds [[Jessica Jones]] and sits with her to talk about Murdock's death and what happened between them. He tells her that any one of them could have died in the cave, but he is glad that she was one of the survivors, and he asks that she keep in touch.

[[File:TChaka-NewsSpeech.jpg|thumb|255px|[[T'Chaka]] talks about the incident in Lagos]]
*In an interview the month after the [[Attack on the IFID Headquarters|incident in Lagos]], the king of [[Wakanda]], [[T'Chaka]], says that he and his nation support the Sokovia Accords.<ref name="CACW"/><ref name="CACW One Month">As Rogers watches TV, the [[Attack on the IFID Headquarters]] is stated to be "last month". The ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming Prelude]]'' also states that the [[Bombing of the Vienna International Centre]] is "one month later", after Lagos. WHiH gave the timeline date for the Lagos incident as May 3, 2016 (see other references), putting the rest of the events of ''Captain America: Civil War'' in June. However, in ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'', it jumps forward to "two months later," to the firm date of September 8, 2016. Assuming the 2 is rounded, this still works with June so long as it is very late June. It has to be as late as possible in June, but before schools broke up in New York on June 28th ([http://www.uft.org/news/2015-16-new-york-city-school-calendar 1], [http://schools.nyc.gov/Calendar/2015-16+Calendars 2]), as Parker gets home from school and still has homework to do. In ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'', Stark says that he took Parker for the "weekend," and in [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHOdBhXDdsI an extended version of Peter's video diary] it is shown that the day after the Clash of the Avengers is "Samstag" (Saturday), therefore making the date he picks up Parker Thursday 23rd June, and when he returns him the very early hours of Sunday 26th June. These are the only dates which fit as being a weekend, before schools break up, a rounded 2 months before September 8th, and still the month following the May 3, 2016 Lagos incident, as well as a loose (May to June) "one month" after the incident, thus placing ''Captain America: Civil War'' firmly around these dates.</ref>

T'Challa loses focus at seeing his ex-girlfriend again, and a terrorist takes advantage of the moment, threatening to shoot one of the girls if T'Challa moves.

**T'Challa arrives at the waterfall in a jet and steps out to face his people. [[Zuri]] has T'Challa drink a concoction which strips away the powers of the [[Heart-Shaped Herb]], and each tribe is asked if they wish to challenge him for the throne. While the four tribes do not challenge, the fifth, [[Jabari Tribe]] surprises the citizens of [[Wakanda]] by making an appearance. Their chief, [[M'Baku]] challenges T'Challa.<ref name="BP"/>
**T'Challa and M'Baku engage in a duel for the throne of Wakanda. M'Baku uses his brute strength, whereas T'Challa utilises agility. M'Baku looks set to win as he spears T'Challa in the shoulder, but T'Challa removes the weapon and tackles M'Baku to the ground. Holding him in a lock at the top of the waterfall, T'Challa demands that the Jabari chief yields, not wanting to kill him. M'Baku eventually, reluctantly accepts his defeat.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>

*A few hours later, as evening arrives in [[Wakanda]], [[T'Challa]] is taken to the [[City of the Dead]] to commune with his father on the [[Ancestral Plane]].

*T'Challa's mind enters the Ancestral Plane and he walks in a savanna. He comes across a tree with several black panthers, and one of the animals leaps from the tree, changing form into [[T'Chaka]]. Pleased to see his father again, T'Challa embraces T'Chaka. T'Challa confesses to his father that he does not feel prepared to be king, and T'Chaka advises his son to surround himself with good people.

With it being difficult to stretch the events of the episode over these 17 months, it would help for Murdock waking from his coma to be as late as realistically possible to minimize the stretching of the scenes after. When Murdock wakes, it is said that he was comatose for "several weeks". With him falling unconscious on May 10, 2016, realistically, the latest it should be is the end of June, with early July leaning more toward "2 months", so June 30, 2016 can be used.<br>By the time of Benjamin Donovan visiting Wilson Fisk in prison, it is less than a month from October 23, 2017, as Fitz finds out about the troubles with Vanessa Marianna when Donovan visits and then at his next meeting with the FBI wants to make a deal because of it, and the meetings are said to be monthly. So, with it already being a big stretch to have the events span 17 months, the Donovan scene should be as early as possible to minimize the stretching for all scenes up to then, so around September 24, 2017. The scene before, of Murdock moving into the laundry room, is shown to be the same day as Fisk being visited in prison, so September 24, 2017.<br>Therefore, the scene of the orphans visiting Murdock and Page and Nelson discussing Murdock's apartment should be distributed between June 30, 2016 and September 24, 2017, so November 27, 2016 and April 27, 2017 respectively.</ref><ref name="TD108"/><ref name="DD301"/>

===July===
====1st====
*[[T'Challa]]'s first day as king of [[Wakanda]] begins. He walks among his people, talking to [[Nakia]] as he passes through the market.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>
*The new king contacts [[Steve Rogers]] and [[Bucky Barnes]] to let them know Wakanda is ready to bring them in to help Barnes.<ref name="CACW/BP Problem">In ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'', it is shown that some time after T'Challa returned home to Wakanda, he harbored Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes and allowed Barnes to be cryogenically frozen while his people worked on a potential solution. This therefore has to occur after T'Challa's return to Wakanda on June 30, 2016.<br>However, on July 3, 2016, Shuri says, "Great! Another broken white boy for us to fix." This is a reference to her work on Bucky Barnes, which suggests that she has begun work on him by July 3, 2016. There is no space between July 1st and July 3rd in which she could have been helping Barnes as soon as all the problems with Klaue began, so the only options are that either this scene takes place in the day between T'Challa's coronation and the Klaue situation beginning, June 30th-July 1st, or after the main events of ''Black Panther'', July 7th or later. If it is the latter, the assumption has to be made that Shuri has begun the project either because she has been informed of Barnes' problem or even because Barnes has arrived in Wakanda and is being hidden (though that takes more assumption and is implausible considering his absence during the events of the film).<br>The ultimate answer comes in the ''[[Avengers: Infinity War Prelude]]'', where it is shown that after the escape from the Raft on June 26, 2016, Rogers and Barnes spent approximately 2 days helping their friends as Lang and Barton arranged their house arrest deals (explained in ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' and ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]'') then were dropped home, and it was arranged that Wanda Maximoff would meet in secret with Vision, and then she was dropped off to meet with him around June 28, 2016. Following this, it is then shown that "weeks later", Barnes and Rogers speak with T'Challa in Wakanda, and then T'Challa takes Barnes to be frozen. This therefore means the ''Captain America: Civil War'' scene cannot be June 30th or July 1st, as this would be merely 2-3 days later, meaning it has to be after the events of ''Black Panther'', and Shuri is merely talking about having begun her work on the project to fix Barnes' mental conditioning.<br>The scene is presented as being not long after Rogers' fight with Stark on June 24, 2016, as he still has some bruising on his face. "Weeks" realistically implies at least 2½ or so weeks, and it should not be more than that considering the bruising, so overall, the scene is placed just over 2½ weeks, 18 days later, on July 16, 2016 (3 weeks after Rogers' fight with Stark, between T'Challa kissing Nakia and T'Challa taking Shuri to Oakland).</ref><ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>
*T'Challa visits his good friend [[W'Kabi]] at the rhino paddock, and T'Challa mentions what Nakia has been talking to him about - the prospect of opening up the borders of Wakanda to immigrants. W'Kabi is not happy with this idea, believing T'Challa should protect Wakandans first.

*In the throne room, [[Okoye]] delivers the news that [[Ulysses Klaue]] has shown up on their radar again, after evading Wakanda's searches for almost 30 years since he [[Attack on Wakanda|attacked the country and stole vibranium]].

[[W'Kabi]] shows particular interest in taking down Klaue, since the arms dealer killed his parents during his attack on the country, but [[T'Challa]] tells him he has to remain to protect the [[Wakanda]]n border.

**The trio of Wakandans arrive at the casino in Busan to prepare for [[Ulysses Klaue]], who plans to make a deal to sell vibranium in exchange for diamonds.

**As the Wakandan trio debate whether to act, [[Okoye]] snaps at [[Nakia]] in Xhosa, giving herself away as a Wakandan. One of Klaue's men attacks, and Okoye throws off her wig, abandoning her fake identity and fighting back as a conflict erupts.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>
**T'Challa confronts Klaue, but the arms dealer uses his [[Ulysses Klaue's Prosthetic Arm|weaponized vibranium arm]] (a special replacement for the arm he lost to [[Ultron]] the year before) to cause a distraction and try and escape, with T'Challa's group in pursuit.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>
**[[Shuri]] excitedly takes control of a car and drives, with T'Challa on the roof, in pursuit of Klaue, as Okoye and Nakia drive a vibranium car themselves. Klaue's men fire at the vibranium car to no effect, and shoot at T'Challa, allowing him to absorb the kinetic energy. Okoye throws a vibranium spear to take out one of Klaue's cars, and T'Challa unleashes a blast of kinetic energy to take down Klaue himself.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>
**[[T'Challa]] extends his claws to kill [[Ulysses Klaue]] and walks up to him to take him out. However, as Nakia and Okoye arrive on the scene with [[Everett Ross]], T'Challa is reminded not to kill with the whole world watching, as citizens have gathered around with cell phones to record. He takes a moment and steps back, allowing Ross to take Klaue into CIA custody.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>
*Morning comes in [[South Korea]], and [[Ulysses Klaue]] is held for interrogation by the [[CIA]] in the [[CIA South Korean Black Site]]. T'Challa and Okoye tell [[Everett Ross]] that they will take him back to [[Wakanda]], but Ross refuses, agreeing instead to simply let them also question Klaue. Before Ross enters, T'Challa places his hand on his shoulder and thanks him, subtly placing a listening device on Ross' shoulder.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>
*Ross interrogates the arms dealer, who claims that his "supplier" is the Wakandans, with his [[Ulysses Klaue's Prosthetic Arm|arm cannon]] being made from their vibranium. He asks what Ross actually knows about the country, and Ross says that he knows it is a third world country of shepherds and textiles, but Klaue informs him this is all a front, and he only stole a tiny amount of the precious metal in comparison to the mountain the Wakandans have.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>
*[[Nakia]] notices a van outside that she considers suspicious. Meanwhile, Ross confronts T'Challa about Klaue's claims, but T'Challa maintains that their country is not particularly special, and that Klaue is simply lying.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>
*Nakia goes to check the security footage and spots that it has been looped. Realizing something is wrong, she rushes to inform T'Challa and Okoye. Outside, [[Killmonger]], [[Linda]], and a man they have hired get out of the van and set explosives to detonate on the side of the black site building. Nakia gets to her friends, but before she can warn them, the explosions go off and Killmonger breaks into the interrogation room.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>
*Killmonger shoots at the CIA and Wakandans while Linda and the man they have hired carry Klaue into the back of the van. One of the bullets is aimed at Nakia, but Ross jumps in the way to stop it killing her, hitting him instead. Killmonger then throws a grenade to keep the group from chasing after him, but T'Challa, activating the [[Panther Habit]], leaps onto it to absorb the energy of the explosion. He then pursues Killmonger as their assailant jumps onto the leaving van to escape. However, as he runs to catch the man, Killmonger shoots at him again, causing the kinetic energy build-up in the Panther Habit to overload, going off in a burst of kinetic energy that stops the Black Panther in his tracks. As the attackers get away with Klaue, T'Challa notices a Wakandan royal ring around the main assailant's neck.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>
*[[Okoye]] catches up with T'Challa and ushers him inside to check on Nakia. They find her safe and well, but standing over Ross, who has been severely injured. T'Challa requests that they be allowed to take Ross back to Wakanda, knowing that his only hope of survival and recovery is [[Shuri]]. The CIA agree and he stabilizes Ross with a [[Kimoyo Beads|Kimoyo Bead]], then they carry him to their ship.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>
*A few hours later, the trio arrive back at Wakanda with Everett Ross unconscious aboard their ship.

*[[W'Kabi]] visits T'Challa to ask where they have [[Ulysses Klaue]], but the king sadly admits to his friend that Klaue slipped through their hands. W'Kabi expresses his disappointment to his friend, highlighting that in the almost 3 decades that T'Chaka was king, he had never managed to catch the arms dealer who had killed his parents, and while he had hoped T'Challa would be more successful, he is simply showing himself as no better than his father.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>
*'''[[Assassination of Ulysses Klaue]]''':
**Arriving at a junkyard where their getaway plane is waiting, Klaue reassures Killmonger that his payment will come shortly. Killmonger waves this away, saying he is not concerned with money, but only hopes that on Klaue's return flight to [[Johannesburg]], he drop them off in Wakanda. The arms dealer refuses, saying they would be crazy to go there, and Killmonger becomes angry, killing the man he and Linda hired and turning his gun on Klaue.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP">''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]''</ref>
**Klaue grabs Linda and holds a gun to her head, threatening that if Killmonger shoots, he will kill her. Unwavering in his determination, Killmonger unsympathetically kills Linda to remove Klaue's leverage, then pursues him across the junkyard. He eventually catches up to Klaue, shooting him. The man falls to the ground and as Killmonger approaches, tells him that the Wakandans are savages who will treat him as an outsider. However, Killmonger reveals his [[War Dogs Tattoo]] inside his lower lip, and Klaue comes to an understanding of what his compatriot's campaign has been about all along. He laughs at his own folly until Killmonger shoots him again, killing him.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>
*King T'Challa visits [[Zuri]] in the [[City of the Dead]] and asks him what happened to [[N'Jobu]], believing that the man he saw hours ago must be related to N'Jobu, since his ring was identical to T'Challa's - a ring passed down by [[T'Chaka]]'s father, [[Azzuri]]. Zuri is reluctant to reveal what happened in [[1990s#1992|1992]], having promised T'Chaka to keep it secret, but T'Challa demands the truth as the new king. Zuri sadly confesses what happened, explaining how N'Jobu pulled a gun on him, and T'Chaka reacted by turning and attacking his brother to save Zuri, unintentionally stabbing him in the chest with the [[Panther Habit]] claws. Zuri is ashamed as he then tells T'Challa that he and T'Chaka made the decision to leave N'Jobu's son behind, determining him as a risk to their ability to maintain the lie of what happened to N'Jobu, which they believed was important to keep for the good of the country.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>

*[[Everett Ross]] wakes a little over 24 hours after receiving his bullet wound. Remembering what happened, he reaches for his back, but finds no injury. He confusedly gets up, not understanding where he is or what is happening, and goes over to the only person in sight: Shuri. Shuri is startled by him, but answers his questions, explaining that he is indeed in [[Wakanda]], and that their advanced technology has allowed her to do what he previously thought impossible: heal a bullet wound in just one day. He learns that T'Challa was in fact hiding the truth from him, as Wakanda is overflowing with [[vibranium]] resources, with Shuri excitedly showing him inventions such as the magnetic levitation train and sonic stabilizers which temporarily deactivate vibranium and allow it to be transported. She then receives a message from [[Okoye]] via her [[Kimoyo Beads]], informing her that a stranger has shown up at the border claiming to have killed Ulysses Klaue. Okoye says that he is also not an outsider, but a Wakandan, showing an image of Killmonger. Ross, however, recognizes him and says that he cannot be Wakandan, as he works for the CIA.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>

*[[T'Challa]] sits with [[Nakia]] over a valley in Wakanda, and tells her about his father's actions, trying to understand how the man he loved, respected, and looked up to could have acted this way. Nakia reassures him that despite his father's actions, he need not be defined by them - he gets to decide what kind of king he himself is going to be.

*Killmonger meets with the [[Tribal Council]] to announce his intentions. He declares that he wants the throne, and for Wakanda to arm the 2 billion African diaspora around the world with vibranium so they can fight for themselves. T'Challa claims that he is only king of Wakanda and needs to focus on his people, not the people around the world, and quietly tells Killmonger that the only reason he does not have him killed is because he is aware of who he is. When the king then requests that he be taken away, Killmonger then coaxes the Tribal council into asking who he is, and when the [[River Tribe Elder]] gives in, he announces his true identity as [[N'Jadaka]], son of N'Jobu. [[Ramonda]] questions his truthfulness, but [[W'Kabi]] steps forward and presents Killmonger's royal ring, verifying his story.

**Killmonger refuses to give in and gets back on his feet immediately. The duel continues, and T'Challa manages to slash Killmonger's face.

Finally, he gets in close to T'Challa and uses the spear to stab him in the gut.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>
**Killmonger goes in to kill the king, saying he is avenging his father, when [[Zuri]] suddenly steps in to block him.

**T'Challa cries out at his mentor's murder and crawls to him as he dies, but Killmonger calls out to the witnesses, asking if this defeated and helpless man is really fit to be king, and then picks him up from the ground.

He enters the Ancestral Plane, which manifests for him as his [[1990s#1992|1992]] [[Oakland]] apartment, and he sees his father, [[N'Jobu]].

====5th====
*As morning comes in [[Wakanda]], [[Killmonger]] finally takes his seat on the throne. The council of the tribe elders convenes and discuss Killmonger's plans. [[W'Kabi]] explains that the outside world's technology is catching up with theirs, and they need to ensure they are the conquerors rather than letting themselves become the conquered. The new king then sets the Wakandans to work on his plans to use [[vibranium]] technology to strong-arm the African diaspora across the world.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>
*[[Nakia]], [[Ramonda]], [[Shuri]], and [[Everett Ross]] arrive at [[Jabari Land]], planning to deliver the [[Heart-Shaped Herb]] to [[M'Baku]] in hopes that he'll help them fight back. [[Jabari Tribe|Jabari]] tribesmen suddenly emerge from hiding places to surround them, and the group are taken to meet with M'Baku.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>
*Night falls, and the group are taken to meet with M'Baku. They ask for his help, but he shows reluctance, feeling that if [[T'Challa]] lost in ritual combat, then the defeat was fair. When Ross tries to interject, M'Baku and the Jabari make heavy gorilla noises to intimidate him, and M'Baku threatens to feed the man to his children, to put him in his place - though he admits after that he is joking, beginning to show the group a softer side. When Nakia offers him the Heart-Shaped Herb, he rejects it and tells them to follow him.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>
*M'Baku leads the way and shows the group that T'Challa is not, in fact, dead, but they have him preserved in a vegetative state in a mound of snow after their fisherman found him. Ramonda, Shuri, and Nakia are elated, but when they ask to take him away, M'Baku says that he will die if they move him. Nakia realizes that the herb might give him strength, and they prepare the substance. They feed T'Challa the herb and bury him completely with the snow, allowing him to visit the [[Ancestral Plane]] once again.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>
*In the Ancestral Plane, T'Challa speaks with [[T'Chaka]] once more. He confronts his father about the decision he made to abandon Erik Stevens as a child. T'Chaka insists that he made the decision to protect the stability of the people, but T'Challa tells him he was wrong in that action, and that he was wrong in all his negligence towards the rest of the world.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>
*T'Challa wakes and happily reunites with his family and friends.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>
*Dawn breaks in Wakanda, and [[Nakia]] updates T'Challa on [[Killmonger]]'s actions. [[Shuri]] returns the [[Panther Habit]] to her brother and tells him she will fight by his side, with Nakia and [[Everett Ross]] agreeing to help in the battle as well. T'Challa then asks to speak to M'Baku before they leave.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>
*T'Challa asks M'Baku for help - to offer Jabari tribesmen to fight for his cause in retaking the throne of Wakanda from Killmonger, whose actions are far too dangerous. M'Baku says that he owed T'Challa a great debt in sparing him at the [[Incoronation of T'Challa|coronation duel]], but that he has repaid it in saving him, and he will not offer Jabari lives in a fight that is not theirs.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>

====6th====
*A few hours later, Killmonger sets his plan into motion, preparing ships to distribute [[vibranium]] weaponry to the [[Africa]]n diaspora, with [[W'Kabi]]'s help. The first ship takes off, but does not make it far before suddenly falling out of the sky. Confused, Killmonger looks on at the wreckage on [[Mount Bashenga]] and sees the [[Black Panther]] emerge from behind it, climbing over the top and making his way towards his cousin. [[Okoye]] expresses her delight at her king and friend's survival. T'Challa lets down his helmet to talk with Killmonger, calling out that he never yielded, and since his is not dead, their challenge is not yet over. Killmonger insists that that is of no consequence and orders the remaining ships to launch.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>
*'''[[Battle of Mount Bashenga]]''':
**[[W'Kabi]] remains loyal to Killmonger and sends the [[Border Tribe]] to attack T'Challa, but the [[Dora Milaje]], led by Okoye, turn on the usurper and fight back. T'Challa begs his friend to stop the fight, but W'Kabi refuses, blowing a horn to summon war rhinoceroses.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>
**Nakia, Shuri, and Ross return to [[Shuri's Lab|Shuri's lab]]. Nakia reluctantly dons a Dora Milaje armor to wear for protection while Shuri gives Ross brief instructions for flying a Wakandan ship, so that he can help take down Killmonger's ships of vibranium weaponry. Shuri takes her [[Vibranium Gauntlets]] and the women leave to join the fight.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>
**In his fight with the Dora Milaje, Killmonger defeats one of the women. He slits her throat gleefully, enraging the remaining warriors further.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>
**[[Shuri]] reaches the land and uses the gauntlets to blast opponents out of the way. USing a communication device, she gives Ross further instructions to pilot the ship, and he takes off to stop Killmonger's ships from leaving.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>
**Black Panther continues to fight alongside the Dora Milaje against the Border Tribe, taking down one of the rhinoceroses.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>
**Okoye and her fellow warriors seemingly beat Killmonger in battle and trap him with their spears, but when they press in further, his suit absorbs the kinetic energy and then blasts it back, sending the women flying.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>
**[[Everett Ross]], meanwhile, begins shooting at the ships trying to leave [[Wakanda]], in hopes of stopping them.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>
**As he fights, Black Panther is caught off guard and hit by a Border Tribe rhinoceros. His suit falters and he struggles to get back up.<ref name="BP"/>
**Killmonger bests Nakia in combat, so Shuri tries to fight herself. While her gauntlets are initially successful, they begin to malfunction, and her cousin beats her down.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>
**Border Tribesmen attack T'Challa while he is incapable of fighting back, but the kinetic energy begins to be stored again in the [[Panther Habit]]. As he is attacked, T'Challa sees his sister in peril and finds it in himself to get back up, wanting to help her. He lets out another kinetic blast and goes to save her.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>
**As Killmonger moves in to kill Shuri, T'Challa suddenly leaps to tackle him, and the two men fall into the [[Great Mound]] together.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>
**T'Challa communicates with Shuri and asks her to turn on the [[Wakandan Maglev Train|maglev train]], knowing its sonic stabilizers interfere with their Panther Habits and will make his opponent more vulnerable. Shuri points out that he will also be exposed, but T'Challa is confident and Shuri activates the train with her [[Remote Access Kimoyo Beads]]. As it goes past, the men are separated either side of the track. T'Challa tells Killmonger he has become the thing he hates and will see the world divided, but Killmonger claims he owes the world nothing, as it took everything away from him, and now he is simply settling the score with T'Challa, killing everyone he cares about. The end of the train passes and, angered, T'Challa prepares to engage his cousin again.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>
**As Ross continues to go after Killmonger's ships, an enemy ship arrives outside Shuri's lab and begins shooting at the glass protecting him.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>
**As the battle on [[Mount Bashenga]] continues, the Border Tribe encircle the greatly outnumbered forces fighting for T'Challa. They activate their energy shields and close in on the group to finish the fight.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>
**Just as all seems lost, the [[Jabari Tribe]] arrive, having had a change of heart, and attack the Border Tribe from the side. T'Challa's allies escape the circle and become able to fight back.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>
**T'Challa and Killmonger continue to duel in the Great Mound.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>
**The ship Everett Ross is remotely flying is attacked by Killmonger's forces. It starts to fail, but [[Shuri]] advises Ross via communication devices on how to escape. He controls the ship to let out a sonic overload, breaking free of the enemy ships' restraints. The ship begins to fall, but it reboots just in time to not crash. Ross then manages to shoot down the final ship just in time to leave Shuri's lab before Killmonger's forces can break through the glass, and gets himself to safety.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>
**W'Kabi charges at [[M'Baku]] on a rhinoceros, but just as he is about to hit the Jabari chief, [[Okoye]] steps in to stop her husband. Recognizing Okoye as a friend, the rhinoceros stops, and Okoye then holds her spear up to W'Kabi. W'Kabi sadly asks his wife if she would really be willing to kill him, but, loyal as always, the general says that if it were for the country of Wakanda, there is no question. He reluctantly drops his weapon, leading the Border Tribe to submit, and ending the [[Battle of Mount Bashenga]].<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>
*'''[[Duel in the Great Mound]]''':
**The maglev train passes again and [[T'Challa]] and [[Killmonger]] are forced to one side of the track as they fight. Killmonger pushes his cousin to the edge to throw him over the side, but T'Challa resists. However, as soon as the train finishes passing, he then makes a sudden move in retaliation, twisting around Killmonger to get back onto the track and simultaneously striking his cousin's arm, knocking his knife out of his hand and into the air. As T'Challa gets around him, he catches the knife as it falls back down and swings it into Killmonger's chest.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>
**Killmonger accepts his defeat, reluctantly admitting T'Challa has impressed him with his skill. He tells T'Challa that his father told him that [[Wakanda]] was the most magnificent place in the world, and he had always wanted to see it in its beauty. As a show of empathy for his cousin, knowing that his father is greatly responsible for Killmonger's troubled life, T'Challa decides to help his cousin and carries Killmonger to the elevator up to the surface.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>
**The cousins rise on the elevator and out into the light. T'Challa stands and Killmonger kneels on the rocks to witness the beautiful sunset over Wakanda, as [[N'Jobu]] had told him stories of for all his childhood. T'Challa offers him healing, saying that they will be able to help him if he lets them, but Killmonger asks what purpose this would serve, if they will only end up locking him up. He asks that he be allowed one last request: that the Wakandans bury him in the ocean, with their slave ancestors who drowned themselves knowing, as he does, that death was better than bondage. He succumbs to his wound and dies watching the sun go down.<ref name="BP June-July 2016 Placement"/><ref name="BP"/>

*King [[T'Challa]] brings his sister, [[Shuri]], to [[Oakland]], [[California]], and takes her to a basketball court. She does not understand his intentions, but he explains that it is the location of [[T'Chaka]]'s [[Assassination of N'Jobu|death]] and where Killmonger grew up, and that now he has bought local buildings to start a [[Wakanda]]n outreach center, and wants her to help. He hopes to use their resources to help the impoverished youth and prevent anyone further from suffering Killmonger's tragedies. T'Challa then uncloaks a Wakandan jet that descends on the basketball court, impressing the young boys who are playing. One boy walks over to T'Challa, realizing he is likely the owner of the jet, and asks him who he is. T'Challa smiles.<ref>At the end of ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'', there is a small time jump after Nakia and T'Challa rekindle their romance, taking the film to its final scene, in Oakland. It is implied to be not long after the main events of the film, but it would have taken T'Challa some time to have bought the buildings and started to make plans. It is is approximated as 2 weeks after T'Challa and Nakia's kiss. The kiss was July 7, 2016 morning (approximately 10AM) Wakandan time, which is 2AM Eastern time, July 6, 2016 11PM California. Therefore, the closest midday (roughly when this scene is set) to a fortnight after is midday Pacific July 20, 2016.</ref><ref name="BP"/>

[[File:Terrigen Map.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Inhuman Outbreak]] continues until October 30th]]
*Receiving news about the [[Inhuman Outbreak]], [[Black Bolt]] orders [[Triton]] to go to [[Earth]] to seek out the newly emerged [[Inhumans]] and bring them back to [[Attilan]], keeping the mission quiet from the rest of the [[Inhuman Royal Family]].<ref name="I1 Placement">In ''[[Behold…The Inhumans!]]'', it is shown that the Terrigen outbreak from ''[[S.O.S. Part Two]]'' is ongoing. It is also referenced as being "recent". In ''[[Laws of Nature]]'', it is shown on a detailed simulation that the Terrigen dispersal will be complete 17 months and 21 days after it started, on May 9, 2015. This would place its completion around October 30, 2016, suggesting that Day 1 of the show takes place before this. While it is possible that it occurs after, with the Terrigen still in the water, it is unlikely, especially with the outbreak still "recent". In ''[[The Gentleman's Name is Gorgon]]'', Audrey references the Sokovia Accords, asking Crystal if the Inhuman royal family should "be on a register or something." This places Day 5 of the show after June 22, 2016, when the Accords were ratified. Overall, this suggests that Day 3 is approximately August 26, 2016, the midpoint between these dates. On Day 3, in ''[[Divide -- And Conquer]]'', Medusa picks up that day's paper, and it is a Sunday edition. The closest Sunday is August 28, 2016, therefore placing the show approximately around that date, from August 26-31, 2016. This also matches a report claiming that [http://comicbook.com/marvel/2017/09/04/marvels-inhumans-spoilers-agents-shield-connections/#4 Scott Buck said the royal family are aware of Quake]. Quake would have caused several incidents at this point and become public knowledge. Makani also says in ''[[Those Who Would Destroy Us]]'' that Gorgon "must be one of those Inhumans I've read about." There is not a clear moment in ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' that Inhumans become public knowledge, but it is safe to say that by Quake's incidents, the public is aware.</ref><ref name="I101"/>

Hogan continues not to reply, as he has done all summer.<ref name="SMH 19-Day Span">In ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'', the film begins after the "two months later" text on a school day, and the following day, the day of Liz Toomes' party, is later said to have been a Friday. What is implied to be the following school day, therefore Monday, is when Parker puts the tracker on Toomes' men. The next day (as Parker has to rush, he has not had another day to ask), Parker rejoins the decathlon team as they leave, the day before the competition. A poster early in the film says that the decathlon will be on October 13-15, and at that point Mr. Harrington also asks if Parker cannot spare one weekend for it. However, later, another poster is more clearly shown with the date of September 14th, which makes more sense with all the other evidence and is more prominent and presumably newer, therefore this is the date for it, and the weekend mention is no longer valid as the date must have been changed since then. However, when they get back into school, the Washington incident is referred to on the Midtown High TV news as having happened "this weekend". There is an internal inconsistency here, as at least 2 days after the incident, Parker refers to Toomes' party as "last Friday", but it cannot be "last Friday" if there has been at least another school day + a "weekend" since the party, as well as the fact that the men coming to find the Chitauri object cannot realistically be more than the first school day after the party, and Parker rejoining the group cannot be realistically more than the day after that. With the September 14th date, which is a Wednesday, this all lines up much better as the film starting on Thursday 8th, the party being Friday 9th, Toomes' men coming on Monday 12th, Parker rejoining the group on Tuesday 13th, and then the incident on the 14th. It can be assumed that following the incident, Parker's classmates spent another day or so in Washington, D.C., and/or were not in on Friday to allow them to recover, and so they are returning on Monday, victorious, and the school news incorrectly reports it as having happened at "the weekend" - besides, they are presented as unreliable newsreaders. It has to be assumed either way that the "last Friday" is simply a Monday referring to "not the Friday just been, but ''last'' Friday". This would then be the Monday, September 19th, putting the Ambush on the Staten Island Ferry on the 20th, and the homecoming dance on Friday 23rd, which fits perfectly with [http://imgur.com/t/Awesome/hfkqJ this ticket prop an extra posted a photo of], and [https://www.comicbookmovie.com/spider-man/homecoming/the-wall-crawler-strikes-a-familiar-pose-in-new-spider-man-homecoming-promo-art-a150330 matching tickets officially on display at an event in Japan]. While Happy Hogan says on the 8th that he has to clear out Avengers Tower by next week, it can be assumed that he had to clear it by the Sunday ahead of some other business, before the actual moving the following Friday.</ref><ref name="SMH Placement">With ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' extremely firmly placed in June 2016 from evidence supplied by ''WHiH World News'', ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'', and the film itself, and ''[[The Avengers]]'' firmly placed in 2012 from evidence supplied by ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'', the [[:File:Marvel-Movie-Universe.jpeg|MCU timeline]] coupled with the film itself, and from other films, the "8 years later" has to be ignored as a major continuity error at least until the evidence overrules the huge current evidence for 2012 and 2016. See [[User blog:BEJT/Why The Avengers Has to Be in 2012, Civil War (and Thus Homecoming) Has to Be in 2016, and "8 Years Later" Cannot Work|here]] for the many reasons why. It is generally accepted as such, though unconfirmed. ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' is shown to be "2 months later" following Parker returning home, and is clearly set in September, putting it beginning in early September 2016, a rounded 2 months after late June. The fact that Aaron Davis' date of birth is shown as April 1984 and he is said to be "33" also has to be overlooked as a minor, common error due to the staggering evidence that ''Captain America: Civil War'' cannot occur later than 2016.</ref><ref name="SMH"/>

It is said in ''[[Vendetta]]'' that "Coulson had just stepped down" in the scene in which we see him heading off to board the Zephyr for the beginning of the six-month span. Due to the April 17, 2017 date in ''[[Wake Up]]'', ''[[The Ghost]]'' ideally picks up in March 2017 (see other references). Working back from this, the events of ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot]]'', and the first boarding of the Zephyr, is in September 2016. This works with ''Slingshot'', as it picks up just before ''[[Broken Promises]]'' on April 13, 2017 (see other references), it then flashes back to the Baltimore incident, referring to it as "Several months ago". With the Baltimore event on September 30, 2016, this is 7 months prior. It is dated as late September - September 30, 2016, to allow time for Mace being selected for, and then go through Project Patriot, but still fit with Mace's statement in ''[[The Patriot]]'', "Few months [after Vienna], Talbot came to me with an offer." This still fits, with the bombing being on June 22nd, and his selection being September 8th, 2½ months later. It is implied that Mackenzie and Coulson began testing the limits of the Zephyr, to go for weeks and weeks on a thorough hunt for Johnson, and that the director wanted to keep [[Coulson's Team]] apart after he took over, as the duo get to only see their friends every few weeks when coming back for restock. They get back after their last trip of 6 weeks (their furthest yet, impressing Fitz), and Fitz and Simmons are excited to see them, with Fitz exclaiming, "Six weeks. That's a record!" Coulson at this point has indeed spent 6 months with Mackenzie living mostly on the plane - September 30, 2016 to March 18, 2017.</ref>

When a committee member questions what a third-world country could have of particular value, [[Everett Ross]], who is in attendance, smiles at T'Challa to give him the cue to reveal the incredible secrets of Wakanda. T'Challa happily begins.<ref name="BP Credits/AIWP">In ''[[Avengers: Infinity War Prelude]]'', it is shown that "months later" after July 16, 2016, Shuri has nearly worked out how to clear Bucky Barnes' mental conditioning. Soon after this (dialogue implies it is immediately after), Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, and Sam Wilson deal with a terrorist group in Syria. A follow-up on this Syria scene in ''[[Captain Marvel Prelude]]'' shows it to be "months later" after June 24, 2016, suggesting it is late 2016-early 2017. In this scene, Fury says, "And it ain't even Christmas yet," implying that it is not shortly after Christmas (early 2017), but rather not long before, so late 2016. The Shuri scene individually would ideally place around early 2017, being "months" after July 2016, but since it has to occur before the late 2016 Syria scenes, it has to be a little earlier than this ideal placement, also in late 2016 - which is not a problem. However, this means that the later the better - in other words, the closer to the Syria scenes, the better, which matches the implication from the dialogue in ''Avengers: Infinity War Prelude'', placing the Shuri scene and the Syria events most likely on the same day, with nothing suggesting otherwise. So, these can be reasoned to take place [https://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Thread:241334#401 around approximately November 17, 2016], 4 months after July 16, 2016 and almost 5 months after June 24, 2016, but still several weeks ahead of Christmas.<br>Shuri would have begun work on Barnes at some point between July 8, 2016 (after Killmonger's defeat) and July 16, 2016 (when he was frozen), so around July 12, 2016. With Barnes being frozen on July 16, 2016 and that helping her with her work, overall, with those first 4 or so days being roughly half as helpful, it is essentially as if her work began on July 14, 2016. Therefore, on November 17, 2016, she has been working on Barnes for roughly 126 days, and dialogue implies she is approximately 80% complete on finding and finalizing her solution. This would then imply that it would take approximately a further 32 days until Shuri was ready to wake Barnes, suggesting he was woken around December 19, 2016. Finally, the ''Black Panther'' post-credits scene is likely a further few days later, as he has recuperated a little and the Wakandan children are familiar with him - approximately 3 days later, giving December 22, 2016.<br>The United Nations ''Black Panther'' mid-credits scene therefore takes place between July 20, 2016 (approximately 15:00 Eastern, as roughly midday California) and December 22, 2016 (approximately 04:00 Eastern, as roughly midday Wakanda), giving an approximation of roughly October 5, 2016 21:30 Eastern/October 6, 2016 03:30 Vienna. Ultimately, the closest midday in Vienna day is October 6, 2016, which gives October 6, 2016 approximately 04:00 Eastern.</ref><ref name="BP"/>

[[File:6months Punisher.png|thumb|250px|Frank Castle, Pete Castiglione, six months after May 1st]]
*Six months after retiring the role of the Punisher, [[Frank Castle]], now having grown out his hair and beard and under the identity of "Pete Castiglione", works on a construction site, swinging a hammer at a wall repeatedly and not engaging with his co-workers. Some of his colleagues approach him and are rude, with one man trying to provoke him to get angry, but eventually giving up, stepping on Castle's sandwich as he walks away.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement">In ''[[3 AM]]'', Dinah Madani asks Stein for info on "the explosion and drug bust at the 41st Street docks last year", referring to the [[Destruction of the Blacksmith's Ship]]. With that event in ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'': Season 2 firmly placed in November 2015 (with all of the first four Netflix seasons linked together in a very strong 2015 placement), this places at least the beginning of ''[[The Punisher]]'': Season 1 in 2016. In ''[[Resupply]]'', it is also shown that Micro has two collections of computer files - a total of 62 files - in a random order, the earliest of which is "03/05/2015" and the latest of which is "10/24/2016". In 599 days, he added 61 files, meaning that there is roughly an average of a file every 9.8 days. This would therefore suggest that early in the season, it is roughly late October/early November 2016.
<br>In ''[[Kandahar (episode)|Kandahar]]'', just after midnight, Micro says to Frank, "Happy birthday, Frank. It's the 15th. Happy birthday." Around 36 hours later, making it the 16th of the month, in ''Resupply'', Curtis says to Lewis, "Now you're sleeping in a hole in November," placing that scene in November - therefore making it November 16th. This is only 8 days after Madani talked about the drug bust, making that November 8th, in which she said the drug bust was last year, making it 2016 - so, the 3rd day of the main events is November 8, 2016, and thus the main events of the season began on November 6, 2016, and the Curtis scene, on the 11th day, is November 16, 2016. With that being the same day as Micro looking at his files, that also matches with his computer, which implied around late October/early November 2016 - just roughly a fortnight later than the average approximately implied.
<br>On the 19th day of the main events, in ''[[The Judas Goat]]'', it is implied to be around Thanksgiving. This matches perfectly, with 18 days after November 6, 2016 being November 24, 2016 - the exact day of Thanksgiving 2016. The events continue to the end of ''[[Cold Steel]]'', which takes it up to Tuesday, November 29th.
<br>''[[Front Toward Enemy]]'' picks up a few days later, and in the opening of the episode, Lewis Wilson's bombing occurs. Later in the episode, it is stated that the bombing was on "Tuesday", so the bombing is Tuesday, December 6th, 7 days after ''Cold Steel''. In the following episode, ''[[Virtue of the Vicious]]'', the ''Homegrown'' newspaper is shown. On the [http://nybulletin.com/ ''New York Bulletin'' website], it can be seen on that front cover that the bombing is mentioned as being "last week" - despite the episode being the day after Frank is revealed publicly to be alive at the end of ''Front Toward Enemy'' (Billy Russo says, "Up until yesterday, I thought he was dead"), and ''Front Toward Enemy'' only seemingly spanning a couple of days. Therefore, ''Virtue of the Vicious'' should be as early as possible to still be the week after the bombings - Monday, December 12th, and ''Front Toward Enemy'' is spread across 6 days for it to end on Sunday, December 11th, with some gaps placed in the episode, which is just about possible.
<br>In that episode, Senator Ori also says, in a scene dated to December 11, 2016, "It's barely a year since this city was terrorized by the Punisher." This matches perfectly with his attacks in ''Daredevil'': Season 2 being firmly placed in October-November 2015, and again confirms that this season is in 2016. The ''Homegrown'' front cover from December 12, 2016, also says that Frank's trial was "last year", working perfectly again as 2016.
<br>Working from December 12th, the rest of the season plays out, with ''Memento Mori'' on December 14th-15th, and the confrontation in Central Park just after midnight on the 16th. "3 days later" (around 80 hours after the fight), the epilogue occurs on December 19th.
<br>The season, therefore, takes place from November 6, 2016 to December 19, 2016.
<br>In ''Front Toward Enemy'', Lewis Wilson's driving license does say that he was born on "05/30/1991", and Micro says that Lewis is "age 26", which would place the season between May 30, 2017 and May 29, 2018. However, this is overruled by all the previously listed evidence. If the season occurred in late 2017, it would contradict all of this evidence, and/or ''Daredevil'': Season 2 would have to be moved to late 2016 - which in turn would drag Season 1 into early 2016 (since it is several months before Season 2), ''[[Luke Cage (TV series)|Luke Cage]]'': Season 1 into late 2016 (since it overlaps with ''Daredevil'': Season 2), and ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]'': Season 1 into 2016 (since it is between Season 1 and 2 of ''Daredevil''), contradicting a very large amount of evidence placing all four in 2015. Plus, Frank says earlier in the episode that he believes he's "25 years old", which despite being only a guess, would be correct.</ref><ref name="TP101"/>

Hoyle asks him where [[Lewis Wilson]] is, and he says that Wilson has come to understand the right way of life after he had spoken with him.

*Hoyle visits Castle and Micro in [[Micro's Hideout|Micro's hideout]] and lets him know about Russo visiting him.

*Madani talks to [[Sam Stein]] in her office and pretends to have a new lead on Castle, trying to fool whoever is listening through the bug in the office. Stein catches on to what she is doing, and plays along as they discuss a deal that will supposedly be happening soon where Castle will be buying ammunition - they hope to lure the listeners into a trap at the supposed meeting point and time. The conversation then turns to Billy Russo, whom Stein has worked out Madani is sleeping with. He teases her about Russo.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP108"/>
[[File:Sarah kissing Frank.png|thumb|250px|[[Frank Castle|Castle]] being kissed by [[Sarah Lieberman]]]]
*At the Liebermans', Castle reboots the Wi-Fi router, claiming to Sarah that he simply wanted to save her the job. This in turn reboots the feed from Micro's cameras, and he goes back to watching his family. [[Sarah Lieberman]] starts a further conversation with "Castiglione", saying she often sadly wonders if she will ever be able to find love again. She says he is a great listener and goes to hug him, but ends up turning her head to kiss "Castiglione". He backs away shortly after, telling her that he never intended to give her the impression that things could be romantic between them, and Sarah apologizes, saying she hopes it does not affect their friendship. He tells her that he will put it behind him and they laugh off the awkward moment, before Castle leaves the house.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP108"/>
*Castle returns to the hideout and finds [[Micro]] drunk at his computer, struggling to deal with Castle having kissed his wife. He accuses Castle of having encouraged her advances with the flowers, but he says that they were merely bought to give him an excuse for turning up at the house. Micro continues to drink, claiming this is how he will have to deal with the situation.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP108"/>
*[[William Rawlins]] meets with [[Billy Russo]] to discuss the tape from Madani's office, and the fact that they need to intervene with the government operation because Castle has to be killed. Russo believes it is a risk, as it could expose their bug in [[Homeland Security Headquarters]], and says that he needs outside operators as he lost nine men on his payroll on the [[Attack on Gunner Henderson|attack on Gunner Henderson]]. Rawlins asks if Russo is making excuses and is actually worried about going against [[Dinah Madani]], but Russo insists that she is merely a means to an end, and that no one will get in his way, both Madani and Rawlins included.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP108"/>
*At the Homeland Security Headquarters, Madani hands out hard copy tactical plans for the ambush at the fake Castle arms deal. She then talks to Stein about preparing getting into position early before whoever is after Castle arrives, and they go to upload a fake tactical plan into the computers, assuming that whoever placed the bug in the office also has computer access.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP108"/>

*In [[Micro's Hideout|Micro's hideout]], [[Frank Castle]] and David Lieberman start a conversation about their wives and how they each met theirs: how Castle had met Maria while playing guitar in the park, and how Lieberman had been at school with Sarah and had first kissed her after a junior year costume party. Micro, drunk, starts to talk about women and teases Castle about the topic. Castle tells him to stop, but starts to laugh at Lieberman's comments. Lieberman then has an idea, thinking that they should send Dinah Madani the video evidence they have against William Rawlins and then use Castle as an eyewitness to put Rawlins in jail, but Castle insists that they cannot imprison Rawlins, as he needs to be killed. Micro becomes angry, calling Castle a psychopath for his insistence on killing enemies, and goes to call Madani, but Castle punches him to knock him out before he can act.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP108">''[[Cold Steel|The Punisher: 1.08: Cold Steel]]''</ref>

*Russo's team ascend the staircase at the warehouse.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP108"/>
*Castle gets out the knife Lieberman took and begins to talk to him about the weapon, telling him why knives are better than guns in a close-quarters fight. He wants to intimidate Lieberman, and holds him in a headlock with the knife in-hand to show him how awful the weapon is and break his facade of feeling tough. Lieberman shocks him when he says that he wishes Castle would just kill him, telling him how he is scared and lonely and that is bullying behavior has been out of a desire to make other people feel the pain he feels every day. Castle puts down the knife and embraces him. Micro watches from his hideout, distressed at what is happening to his son.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP108"/>

**Russo's team reach the room where the supposed deal is due to happen, but find no one there. [[Dinah Madani]], [[Sam Stein]], and their team then suddenly ambush the group as planned, but the men are fast to respond, immediately killing one of the Homeland Security agents. A fire fight breaks out between the two factions, but Billy Russo escapes out of the east side of the building, killing one of his own struggling men just so his calling out for Russo's help will not give him away.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP108"/>

**Madani alerts Stein about the man escaping, and Stein runs ahead to apprehend him. He approaches the soldier from behind and holds a gun to him, ordering him to drop his weapon, put his hands behind his head, and get on his knees, all of which he does. Stein then walks up to him and removes his mask, but is stunned to find out that the attacker is [[Billy Russo]]. Russo exploits his moment of confusion and swiftly attacks Stein with a hidden blade in his sleeve, stabbing him repeatedly in the gut, and mockingly asking him, "Who's pretty now?"<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP108"/>

*[[Frank Castle]] spends time with [[Zach Lieberman]], throwing an American football between them on the Liebermans' street. He suddenly spots Micro around the corner and throws a long pass for Zach to give him a few moments to speak with David. He hurriedly goes over to tell David to leave. David tells him that he has come because Zach is distressed and needs him, but Castle firmly begs him to leave, warning that if Zach becomes embroiled in anything through either Cerberus finding out David is alive or Zach being around David, Zach is in danger of being killed. David reluctantly walks off just in time, as Zach walks over to Castle and asks who he was speaking to, having only seen him fleetingly from behind. Castle assures him it was just a man hanging around the neighborhood and gets back to playing with the football.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP108"/>

She says that while she is glad Dinah is taking time to recover, it is unlike her to stay bedridden. Dinah explains that she has been wondering what she could have done differently, but Farah reminds her that it is in no way her fault. Dinah explains that Stein's mother has asked her to talk at his funeral, but that she does not know whether to tell a nicer story so as not to upset people, or whether to tell the truth because that was what Stein fought for.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP109"/>

*Lewis Wilson writes a letter addressed to [[Karen Page]] at the ''[[New York Bulletin]]'', saying that the United States government has become tyrannical in trying people who seek to defend themselves with guns in court, claiming he has acted in defense of liberty. He explains that he chose to send it to Page as she is a reporter who previously stood up for the common hero and he believes she understands that sometimes people have to take a stand for what they feel is right. He requests that she publish his words "as a call to arms", or else he will consider her and everyone at the paper to be on his "list".<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP109"/>

*Page receives the letter and shows it to [[Mitchell Ellison]], who believes they cannot take any action until the [[FBI]] have had some involvement in looking at the letter for evidence, which Page reluctantly agrees to, on the proviso that she gets to publish an editorial on the bomber's comments if the FBI approve it.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP109"/>
*Castle watches the news about the bombings and declares his hatred for bombers to Micro, saying that they are cowards who think they can scare people into doing what they want, when in fact they only inspire people to come together. Micro suggests that if the bombing has meant that Madani had to return to work, they could take their opportunity to follow her, but Castle says that the whole city will be paranoid and looking out for suspicious activity, and that they therefore cannot currently go after a Homeland agent.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP109"/>

====11th====
*In [[Micro's Hideout|Micro's hideout]], [[Frank Castle]] reads the ''[[New York Bulletin]]'' article [[Karen Page]] has written about the [[Bombings of New York City|bombings]]. Micro lets Castle know that Page is on the radio.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP109"/>
*Page sits with Senator [[Stan Ori]] in a studio to go live on the [[Ricky Langtry Show]]. The segment begins, and she and Ori have a debate on gun control, with Ori saying that guns in society are far too dangerous, but Page saying that they might be necessary for self-defense. Ori brings up Castle's killings just over a year prior, but Page argues that he is not a terrorist and was working for the side of good. The show then gets a call from an anonymous man claiming to the bomber: [[Lewis Wilson]], indeed the perpetrator of the explosions. He asks Karen why she has said the things she has, and she is defiant, saying she despises his actions and that he is a coward. Wilson calls her a pawn and says that Ori does not represent anyone, claiming the way is just beginning and they are on the wrong side of it, before stating "sic semper tyrannis" (Latin for "thus always to tyrants") and hanging up.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP109"/>
*As Castle listens, he recognizes the Latin phrase and recalls where he heard it before: at one of [[Curtis Hoyle]]'s meetings, spoken by a young man. He describes the man to Micro, saying he remembers he is called Lewis, that he drives a cab, and that he is approximately 25 years old. He asks Micro to find his identity, sure that he is the bomber.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP109"/>
*'''[[Kidnapping of Curtis Hoyle]]''': Curtis Hoyle calls Wilson, hoping to help him, but he does not pick up. He walks to [[O'Connor]]'s home to talk with him about Wilson, but is forced to break in when he becomes worried about the lack of response. He is hit by the smell of a rotting corpse and discovers O'Connor's dead body, as well as the remnants of one of Wilson's explosives. Wilson then approaches him, having been hiding, pulling a gun on Hoyle. Hoyle tries to talk to him, but he is not responsive and lifts the gun to him, forcing Hoyle to engage him in a fight. He knocks the gun out of the young man's hand and manages to knock him to the ground, but Wilson kicks out his prosthetic leg from under him and beats Hoyle, then detaching the leg and hitting him with it until he is knocked out.
*[[Micro]] informs [[Frank Castle]] that he has found the identity of the bomber: Lewis Wilson, as well as hsi address. Castle then gets into the van to go after Wilson, telling Micro that they cannot call Curtis Hoyle for help, as Hoyle will only try to help Wilson and he is too far gone for that to work.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP109"/>
*The [[FBI]] are talking to [[Karen Page]] at the ''[[New York Bulletin]]'' when Castle calls her. He asks her why she is putting a target on her own back by going after Wilson, but she says she had to act so people like the bomber do not get away with their actions. Page works out that Castle knows who the bomber is, but he refuses to tell her, explaining that he has to go after the man first.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP109">''[[Front Toward Enemy|The Punisher: 1.09: Front Toward Enemy]]''</ref>
*[[Billy Russo]] visits [[Dinah Madani]] in her home. She tries to initiate sex, but Russo stops her, saying it will not help her feel better. He then tells her about the times he has had to attend the funerals of people who died serving with him, and that he understands the survivor's guilt of wondering if they could have done anything to stop it, but suggests that it is in fact worth considering that the deaths are sometimes the victims' own faults. Madani admits her plan's intention to bait and catch the people going after Castle, however, explaining that [[Sam Stein]] died for nothing and from a decision she made.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP109"/>
*Micro calls Castle, who is waiting outside Wilson's address, to inform him that he has got a trace on Wilson's cell phone and he is in fact at 83451 Van Buren, mentioning that Hoyle is also in the same house. Castle drives off to go to the address, now also worried about his friend.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP109"/>
*Senator [[Stan Ori]] makes preparations for a fundraising gala to benefit the victims of the bombings. Billy Russo arrives by request, representing [[Anvil]], and the two men discuss Anvil providing his security for the gala. Ori says he is concerned that if the bomber comes after him, if Anvil are forced to shoot the man, it will not reflect well on him as an anti-gun senator, but Russo reminds him that these principles should not be worth dying for, and Ori agrees to hire him.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP109"/>
[[File:Frank saving Curtis.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Frank Castle]] trying to disarm the explosives on [[Curtis Hoyle]]]]
*[[Frank Castle]] gets to 83451 Van Buren and is horrified to find [[Curtis Hoyle]] bloody and beaten, gagged, tied to a chair, and strapped to a mine. Castle takes the gag off him and tries to work out what to do about the M18 Claymore mine. Hoyle's phone then rings and Castle takes the call, which is from [[Lewis Wilson]], positioned outside with a gun trained on the window. He explains that he had to take things into his own hands just like Castle, which Castle rebukes, insisting that Wilson is nothing like him and is a coward hiding behind explosives rather than facing his victims the way he does.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP109"/>
*Dinah Madani tells her mother that she has agreed to speak at Stein's funeral, feeling she owes it to him, as well as saying she has decided to tell the truth, and that despite the fact that it will most likely get her fired, it will mean the federal agents and press will have to act on her words.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP109"/>
*Castle inspects the circuit on the mine strapped to Hoyle. He realizes that he does not know if it is an open or closed circuit, and that if it is closed, any wire he cuts will set off the mine, while if it is open, even then, only some of the wires will be safe to cut. Hoyle begins to talk to Castle about the feelings of helplessness he struggles with following the loss of his leg. Wilson calls again to say he has called the police to come to the house and get Castle, but Castle remains calm, saying he expected Wilson would do that. He is composed as he requests that Wilson tell him which wire to cut, and tells Wilson how Hoyle is a good man and that if anything, he himself is the one deserving of death. He explains how Hoyle lost his leg: that he had been bravely tending to an injured man and it was Castle's job to take out a woman threatening to set off a bomb, but he had hesitated and the explosion had killed Hoyle's patient and blown off his leg. Castle tells him he feels responsible for ruining Hoyle's life.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP109"/>
*Wilson tells Castle to go to the window, and the two talk while looking directly at each other. Castle becomes increasingly stern, trying to appeal to the soldier in Wilson, and demanding that Wilson consider whether he seriously wants both Castle and Hoyle dead. The sound of sirens gets closer, and Wilson knows he has to leave, and he eventually decides he has to tell Castle, instructing him to "try the white wire". He then runs to get away.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP109"/>
*Hoyle encourages Castle to leave, wanting him not to take the risk of being there to cut the wire and to get away before the police arrive. Castle decides to stay nonetheless to support his friend and prepares for the potential that Wilson might have lied as he goes to cut the wire. However, he snips it and nothing happens, as Wilson told the truth. With the mine deactivated, Castle then goes to escape from the police who are arriving outside.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP109"/>
*Although he tries to get away surreptitiously, [[Frank Castle]] is spotted as he escapes. He runs from the police, but a police car apprehends him.

[[File:LewisWilson-ShootingThroughDoor.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Lewis Wilson]] shoots and kills [[Isaac Lange]]]]
*[[Lewis Wilson]], carrying a ''[[New York Bulletin]]'' newspaper which reports on him being responsible for the bombings last week, arrives at [[Anvil]] guard [[Isaac Lange]]'s apartment and shoots him through the door, then breaks in. He is fascinated by Lange's pet birds, before taking Lange's Anvil equipment so as to help him in his attack on Senator [[Stan Ori]]'s gala.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP110"/>
*[[Dinah Madani]] arrives at work at 8:30AM for her first day back and goes to see [[Rafael Hernandez]]. He asks her what she has been hiding in taking the courses of action she has, such as the [[Ambush at the Abandoned Warehouse|ambush at the abandoned warehouse]] and filing the false tactical plans. She confesses to him that she knew Castle was alive and tells him about finding the bug and setting up the fake deal. Madani says she could not report to anyone else, not knowing who else at [[Homeland Security Headquarters]] might be compromised, but Hernandez laments that she did not at least trust him. She decides to give him the name she has come across for the man behind [[Ahmad Zubair]]'s assassination: [[William Rawlins]], and Hernandez is shocked, knowing Rawlins to be the director of Covert Operations, but when she continues to insist she is sure, he decides to consider the information. Before he leaves, he then hands her the files of the attackers who died in the ambush at the warehouse, and Madani immediately notices the trend that they are all affiliated with Anvil.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP110"/>
*At 9:47AM, Senator [[Stan Ori]] tells [[Billy Russo]] he wants to hold his interview with [[Karen Page]] in a visible place so as to prove his not intimidated, but Russo tells him not to, saying that simply keeping him alive should take priority. Russo then gets a call from [[Frank Castle]], who warns him that Lewis Wilson will be coming after Ori and that Russo will need to get Ori to safety, saying that he will be coming to help trap Wilson. Russo says he cannot just take Ori away as he needs to do his job as required, so Castle asks simply that Russo at least keep his security away from him as he goes to take out Wilson. He hangs up and moves to prepare, dressed as a cleaner. Russo meanwhile gets back to work and is introduced to Karen Page as she arrives on Ori's floor of the hotel.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP110"/>
*Now 9:49AM, Russo points out to Page the irony that she, being someone who usually carries a gun, is interviewing an anti-gun senator; however, Page, in return, highlights the irony that Ori should hire a gun-toting security organization. Russo tells her that [[Anvil]] is simply the best security group around, and mentions his status as an [[Afghanistan]] veteran, before leaving to go downstairs to the lobby.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP110"/>
*At 9:54AM, [[Lewis Wilson]] arrives at the gala dressed in Lange's Anvil gear. He spots Billy Russo entering the lobby and turns to avoid him, walking past [[Dinah Madani]].<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP110"/>
*Russo goes to speak with Madani, and he tells her he is glad she has returned to work. She confronts him about the men who killed her team being Anvil recruits, but Russo lies, saying they only worked for him a long time ago, and that they probably worked for several different places, meaning it is only coincidence that all four had at some point been affiliated with Anvil. He becomes angry with her when she continues to press him, pretending it is offensive to him that she could possibly suspect him of having anything to do with the attack. She asks if he would know who the fifth man was - the one who killed [[Sam Stein]] - and he promises to ask around.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP110"/>
*Wilson ascends the stairs to get to Ori. He starts a conversation with the Anvil guard "Eagle One" at the top of the stairs, continuing to pretend to be another Anvil recruit, before suddenly pulling a gun on him and shooting him through the head.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP110"/>
*Madani mentions to Russo that she is aware part of the reason he is working guard duty is to protect Ori from [[Frank Castle]], and she asks if he would truly be ready to take out his friend. Russo claims that while he hopes not to have to deal with that problem, if it came to it, he would be willing, saying Castle has simply gone crazy. An alarm then goes off in the lobby, and Russo contacts Eagle One but becomes concerned when he gets no response, leaving to find out what has happened.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP110"/>
*'''[[Attack on Stan Ori]]''':
**[[Karen Page]] and Senator Ori conduct their interview and discuss their feelings on having had their lives threatened. Meanwhile, Wilson sneaks into the main hallway.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP110"/>
**Page continues to interview Ori, saying that she appreciates the gala Ori is holding, but that his mere rhetoric and the actual effects on real lives are very different things. He replies that he is bringing those things together, however, in taking action to raise money, and highlights that the money would not even need to be raised if it weren't for the violence that lax gun laws allow. Page, in return, posits that a gun is just a tool and not where the violent tendencies lie.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP110"/>
**Wilson steps out into the hall and approaches the next Anvil guard, again continuing his ruse of pretending to be one of them, before killing that man as well. He then goes about rigging explosives in the hallway.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP110"/>
**Ori asks Page why she herself chooses to own a gun, and she informs him it is for personal safety. The senator replies that society should instead be providing personal safety in restricting gun sales, but Page highlights that he himself has chosen gun-bearers as his personal safety insurance.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP110"/>
**Meanwhile, [[Lewis Wilson]] dons a gas mask to prepare to enter the room. Page and Ori continue to debate, but are suddenly interrupted when, at 10:14AM, Wilson detonates the explosives, and they are thrown to the floor. He walks in and shoots the two Anvil guards inside before they have regained awareness of the situation, and [[Stan Ori]] begins begging for his life. Wilson chooses to continue to scare the senator before making any kind of killing shot, but Page then crawls out in front of him to protect him, begging Wilson herself. Wilson decides to kill her, but just as he pulls the trigger, [[Frank Castle]] arrives and dives in front of the bullet.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP110"/>
**Ori runs away, but Wilson grabs Page to hold her hostage, telling Castle that he cannot shoot him, as he has an explosive rigged to a dead man's switch, and if he dies, it will explode and kill Page as well. Castle reluctantly retracts his gun but follows Wilson into the hallway. More Anvil guards arrive from the other end of the corridor, preparing to take out both Wilson and Castle, but Wilson shouts to both parties, threatening blowing up everyone. He backs into an elevator and Castle promises to come to help Page as the doors close, with Wilson descending with Page still held captive.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP110"/>
*The moment the elevator doors close, the [[Anvil]] guards move to shoot at Castle, and he runs for his life. He takes a bullet to the back but manages to get back up and grabs the dead body of the guard Wilson killed in the hallway to carry on his back, using it as a shield from the spray of bullets before turning the corner to escape.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP110"/>
[[File:BRusso-Stairway-Faceoff.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Billy Russo]] takes careful aim at [[Frank Castle]]]]
*Now 10:18AM, Frank Castle continues to attempt to get downstairs and apprehend Wilson. [[Dinah Madani]] meanwhile runs up a nearby staircase then through a hall, exiting onto Castle's staircase and accosting him as he is running, holding a gun to him and telling him to drop his weapon. Agitated and desperate to save Page, he calls her bluff and tells her he needs to get downstairs, and she eventually decides not to shoot, but as he backs away, he is nonetheless shot in the jaw, but from above. Madani looks up and finds [[Billy Russo]], having shot his supposed friend, and preparing to shoot again. She tells him to stand down, threatening to charge him with obstruction, just as Castle gets back up, shocked to find that it is his friend who almost killed him. Russo tells her to walk away from the situation, which is a personal war he feels he is involved with, and she comes to the horrified realization that he was the man who killed Stein.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP110"/>
*At 10:22AM, [[Lewis Wilson]] drags [[Karen Page]] through the lower levels of the building. Officers hold their guns to him, but he threatens them by shouting about he bomb he has on him, ready to detonate if they shoot.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP110"/>
*Before Madani can act on her realization, officers arrive and arrest both her and Russo. Russo is calm and pleased that she cannot retaliate, while Madani screams in anger and begs to be freed, but they refuse. Officers then go after Castle, but he knocks them aside and grabs a fire hose attached to a wall, using it to ensure that he will not fall to the ground as he holds onto it and jumps over the rail to descend several flights of stairs in one go.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP110"/>
[[File:Lewis takes Karen hostage.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Lewis Wilson]] holds [[Karen Page]] hostage]]
*Wilson drags Page into the kitchen with him.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP110"/>
*Castle's fire hose reaches full extension and he dangles over the stairs, then lets go to fall back onto the staircase, now near the bottom floor.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP110"/>
*As soon as they are in the kitchen, Wilson lets go of Page and begins to panic, not knowing what to do next with police outside waiting to take him. Page attempts to calm him down but he only becomes more erratic, beginning to recite drills from his time in the war, and deciding that, as his sergeant once told him, the best thing to do is to "wait like a soldier". Page tells him to back down and offers to help him, trying again to make him relax. However, [[Frank Castle]] then bursts through the door and Wilson grabs Page again, threatening to detonate.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP110"/>
*Castle realizes he is out of options other than to treat Wilson like a soldier - the only way Castle knows he will respond. He begins to berate Wilson for the things he has done, saying that he will have ruined his father's life for forever tarnishing the Wilson family because of his terrorist behavior, and says that Wilson should understand what the right thing to do now would be, and take this course of action. Castle then turns the conversation to discussing Page's bag, confusing Wilson, but Page picks up on his hint: he is checking she has her gun on her, and she subtly indicates that she does. Castle then carefully crafts his words to surreptitiously instruct her to break the white wire on Wilson's explosive, which she does, then he gives a signal and Page shoots Wilson in the foot through her bag, surprising the young man.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP110"/>
[[File:Virtue of the Vicious pic.png|thumb|230px|[[Karen Page]] and the [[Punisher]] get back up]]
*Castle and Page exploit Wilson's moment of surprise, with Page wrestling free of him and the two of them locking him into a freezer. Wilson realizes he has reached the end of the line and recites a military poem to himself as he prepares to end his own life on his own terms; to die "like a soldier". Knowing that this is the only option left for everyone's safety and Wilson's peace, Castle does not move to intervene, but stays with Wilson on the other side of the door until the young man detonates the explosive, killing himself in a fiery explosion and knocking Castle and Page to the ground from the blast.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP110"/>
*With the police waiting outside, Page suggests that Castle pretend to hold her hostage when they step out, hoping that this will allow him to escape. He does so, walking past [[Brett Mahoney]] and the other officers with a gun held to Page's head and threatening her life, before the two of them get into the elevator and relax.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP110"/>
*Castle prepares to escape through the ceiling of the elevator and up through the elevator shaft. Page embraces him, and the two share an intimate moment with their heads pressed together as, without speaking, they communicate to each other how much they care about one another, how grateful they are that each other have made it out alive, and that they hope the other stays safe and well. Castle then climbs out to make his escape.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP110"/>
*As the officers go to the floor the elevator has been stopped at, [[Frank Castle]] meanwhile uses a zip line to escape from the top floor, gliding over to the roof of a nearby building and getting away.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP110"/>
*At 1:45PM, Brett Mahoney sits with [[Billy Russo]] to question him about [[Lewis Wilson]]. He mentions the records they have that Russo looked at hiring Wilson for Anvil, but Russo points out that they had deemed him unfit and that he had no relationship with Wilson. Mahoney suggests he is suspicious of the fact that Wilson easily got past Russo's security, implying that Russo might have been working with him, but Russo angrily highlights the fact that he has lost men who worked with him during the incident, as well as the fact that he risked his life to protect Ori as promised - something he would not have done if he were working with Wilson.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP110"/>
*Mahoney then talks to [[Stan Ori]], asking him to walk him through what happened. Ori explains first how his new experience being involved in a gun-related incident is making him reassess his positions, and that he is in shock. He then tells Mahoney what supposedly happened, but lies to paint himself as a more heroic man, claiming that when Wilson broke in, he had grabbed a gun at shot back at Wilson then run for help.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP110"/>
*When Mahoney interviews [[Karen Page]], she explains that Ori lied, and tells Mahoney that he is wrong to believe Castle and Wilson worked together. Mahoney points out that she and Castle have been involved together several times, suggesting that she will need to provide more proof for her point due to her potentially being suspicious. She highlights that Castle would not go after a man just for a political opinion he disagrees with, and tells the first half of her story from the day.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP110"/>
*[[Dinah Madani]] talks to [[Brett Mahoney]], and says that she believes if Castle had come with the intent of killing Ori, he would be dead. Mahoney asks why Castle would have come otherwise, which Madani admits she does not know, so he asks that she at least tell him her side of the story. Madani explains her perspective on the events.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP110">''[[Virtue of the Vicious|The Punisher: 1.10: Virtue of the Vicious]]''</ref>
*Mahoney interrogates Madani further on what happened in the standoff on the stairs, and she insists that she had the situation under control, but that [[Billy Russo]] had been intent on killing [[Frank Castle]]. Mahoney claims that this is understandable, but Madani highlights that Castle killed no one all day, suggesting this further proves her point that Castle is in fact innocent in this case, and she asks if anyone would actually be willing to give him the chance to prove himself. She then leaves, despite Mahoney not giving her permission.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP110"/>
*Walking down the hall, Madani encounters Karen Page and pulls her aside to talk. She confronts her about having not told her Castle was alive,saying she knows full well that Page knew the truth at the time. She does not press further, however, instead observing that Page and Castle have a connection, and warning her that people will use the ambush as an excuse to go after Castle. Page tells Madani that Castle is not the man that the police believe him to be, reaffirming the agent's beliefs about him.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP110"/>
*Mahoney sits with Karen Page one final time, as she finishes telling him of Castle's actions, and how it should be clear that he is no terrorist, but in fact saved all their lives that day.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP110"/>
*[[Frank Castle]] sits at a fire by the river with homeless people, heartbroken at his best friend's betrayal and thinking over everything that [[Billy Russo]] has said and done.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP111"/>

*Castle sits by the fire, motionless and in shock, into the morning.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP111"/>
*[[Micro]] and [[Dinah Madani]] both separately sit and watch [[WHiH World News]] as Billy Russo speaks out against the man who was once his best friend, saying that Frank Castle has lost the man he once was and become a monster. Madani angrily throws her mug at the television screen, and Castle gets back to [[Micro's Hideout|Micro's hideout]] in time for the end of the report, sharing a look of dismay with Lieberman.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP111"/>
*Micro helps Frank clean and stitch his bullet wounds from the day before, giving him some reassurance as he struggles to come to terms with Russo's betrayal. However, when Castle finds out that Micro went to Madani behind his back, he accuses Micro of also betraying him.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP111"/>
*[[Sarah Lieberman|Sarah]], [[Zach Lieberman|Zach]], and [[Leo Lieberman]] watch the news reporting on Frank Castle, horrified to find out who Pete Castiglione was all along.

*Billy Russo comes in to [[Homeland Security Headquarters]] for a video interrogation, unaccompanied as he claims that if he brought a lawyer, it would imply that he was guilty. She begins the recording and confronts him with the crime scene photos from the [[Ambush at the Abandoned Warehouse|ambush at the abandoned warehouse]], but he refuses to respond about them, instead asking her why she has brought him in. She is direct, saying that he is a murderer and killed [[Sam Stein]], but he twists the story to discredit her, reciting for the video how he picked her up and bathed her and slept with her then and on multiple occasions. She attempts to put the interrogation back on track by questioning if he conducted illegal operations in [[Kandahar]] with Frank Castle, but he derails the conversation again by claiming she is simply angry that Castle escaped from her and is now using him as a scapegoat to blame for her failures. He calls her out for the interrogation being unofficial, due to her doing it on her own, and she stops recording, hoping he will be more open in their conversation, and offers him leniency in return for all his information on executions, tortures, and everything else, to allow her to convict [[William Rawlins]]. Russo lets his guard down momentarily, slipping up as his reaction shows her he is surprised that she knows about him. She angrily says that she will prove he murdered Stein, but he continues to deny, saying she is deluded in her grief. Madani walks to look him directly in his eyes as she gleefully tells him that [[Frank Castle]] will be coming for him now, and that he could be waiting around any corner to kill Russo.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP111"/>
*[[Marion James]] and William Rawlins walk by the river and discuss their personal lives, with James telling him about her twin daughters Ella and Grace applying for college. She tells him she has come to New York to talk with the police commissioner about an incident with his son, who has been caught hacking, offering to clear his name if he joins the [[CIA]]. She asks why Rawlins has come to the city, and he tells her that Frank Castle is a problem, as he could expose activities he performed that he confesses were illegal, albeit claiming that they were done out of a need to defend the country. He tells her that Castle tried to kill him, admitting he had tried to have him killed first. James is stern with him, saying he needs to reflect on himself and berating him for not informing her before. He asks that she sanction his decision to have an asset take out Castle, calling him a terrorist.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP111"/>

*[[Dinah Madani]] shows [[Rafael Hernandez]] the video she recorded, but he scalds her for her methods, saying she helped him build a conflict-of-interest case against her. However, she becomes heated as she says that she had to faze Russo and that they cannot let him get away with the murder of Sam Stein, but Hernandez says she needs to find Castle and [[Micro]] before she proceeds.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP111"/>
[[File:Kidnap-Sarah-Zach.png|thumb|230px|[[Sarah Lieberman|Sarah]] and [[Zach Lieberman]] are kidnapped by [[Anvil]]]]
*'''[[Kidnapping of Sarah and Zach Lieberman]]''': [[Zach Lieberman]] is helping [[Sarah Lieberman|his mother]] prepare food when the doorbell rings and he runs to the door, letting a police officer in. He claims that they got a call from their address to the Frank Castle tip line, and Sarah realizes that Zach must have called, trying to pass it off as a mistake. The officer persists, however, refusing to leave and asking where Leo is. When Sarah sees Leo on the stairs, she indicates for her to stay upstairs and hide, worried the officer is not who he claims to be, then tells the man that she is staying at a friend's house. He says that for their protection, Sarah and Zach should come with him, but when Sarah refuses, he suddenly moves to take them by force, trying to kidnap the mother and son. Sarah fights back, grabbing a kitchen knife, but another supposed officer arrives and threatens her with Zach's life until she drops it, and the two of them are taken away.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP111"/>
*As [[Frank Castle]] prepares for an attack in [[Micro's Hideout|Micro's hideout]], Micro tells him that the skull he is painting should be his "memento mori" - a symbol meant to remind him of how important life is. Castle suddenly notices Sarah and Zach Lieberman's absence in the live feed from their house, and he and Micro rewind the footage, finding out about the kidnapping from a little under an hour prior. Micro begins to panic, but goes back to check the footage when he realizes Leo was not taken. He watches her escaping the house during the kidnapping and running away, and Castle suggests that he should call her.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP111"/>
*[[Leo Lieberman]] walks through a park and gets a call on her phone. Picking it up, she is surprised to hear the voice of "Pete Castiglione". He instructs her to remove the SIM card from her phone and throw both it and the phone away to prevent being tracked. Micro advises Castle to ask her to go to a playground that he had once taken her to, and she says she will go. Once Castle has hanged up, he tells [[Micro]] that he should go to his daughter because she needs him now. Castle explains that he will wait for Rawlins' men to come to the hideout, knowing they will follow the tracker on Sarah's phone, and that he will get information from them on where Sarah and Zach are being held, before killing them all.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP111">''[[Danger Close|The Punisher: 1.11: Danger Close]]''</ref>
*Sarah and Zach Lieberman are held captive, tied to a chair. Rawlins and [[Billy Russo]] discuss having found out that David Lieberman survived [[Carson Wolf]]'s [[Attack on David Lieberman|attack]], and that Castle must have found him. Russo suggests that things are getting out of hand, with the fact that they also had Homeland agents killed and that [[Dinah Madani]] knows about Rawlins' involvement. Rawlins explains that he has used [[CIA]] apparatus to go after the Liebermans, therefore meaning that the CIA will not work against them because if they get exposed, everyone will get in trouble. He tells Russo to kill Castle and Micro tonight, but Russo refuses, saying he has already exposed himself too much.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP111"/>
*[[Marion James]] arrives at the [[Homeland Security Headquarters]] to meet with [[Rafael Hernandez]] and Dinah Madani. They sit her down and tell her they have evidence of one of her field agents running an illegal assassination program funded by heroin from [[Kandahar]], and having killed [[Ahmad Zubair]], revealing the agent to be William Rawlins. James tries to cover him, saying he is highly-decorated, but that she will "look into it". She claims that Homeland Security do not have jurisdiction on foreign operations, but Hernandez explains that agents were killed in an operation in New York because of Rawlins, insisting that he is covering his tracks and killing people, including good agents. James begins to express worry at what the truth might do to damage the CIA's reputation and when Madani says that no one would be surprised, she becomes angry, saying that Madani needs to learn that personal feelings must be abandoned when protecting the country, before leaving.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP111"/>

**Castle stands in his [[Punisher's Vest|Punisher vest]] and awaits Rawlins' men. Sure enough, soldiers soon enter the hideout and begin searching for him. Castle hides in dark corners, ambushing one man to snap his neck, then decapitating another. One of the remaining men phones [[Billy Russo]] to say that Castle is not there and that he left the phone they tracked on a desk, but Russo realizes that this is a trap and warns them that Castle will have intentionally lured them in. At that moment, the decapitated head of the man Castle killed is thrown out of a corridor, and a few of Rawlins' soldiers crowd around it, only to realize too late that Castle has strapped a grenade to it, just as it goes off.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP111"/>

**From behind some crates, Castle calls out, wondering if any of the men are Russo, and threatening to go after his old friend and watch him die. He then triggers his next series of small gunpowder explosions and pulls a hidden gun from one of the crates, getting back up and taking down the men around him, all the time calling out for his old friend. He kills every wounded soldier he finds until he gets to the last man, interrogating him on where Russo and the Liebermans are. When the man tells him he does not know, however, Castle kills him as well, then takes his phone to call Russo.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP111"/>
*On the phone to Russo, Castle tells him that the friend he once knew would have come to do the job of killing him himself, calling him a coward for staying behind. He says that the two of them will eventually end up in a one-on-one confrontation, but Russo says that he will be found soon enough, going on to explain that he has the Liebermans with him and that they are safe for now, but that he is in control of their fate. Castle threatens him in response by saying that [[David Lieberman]] has evidence on Russo to get him convicted, and that if anything happens to Sarah and Zach, it will mean Russo gets exposed.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP111"/>
*[[Marion James]] meets with [[William Rawlins]] to confront him about the deaths in the [[Ambush at the Abandoned Warehouse|ambush at the abandoned warehouse]] and his lies, including hiding the [[Kandahar]] heroin operation. Rawlins claims that they can have Russo blamed for Kandahar and that this would then mean the [[CIA]] get away from the situation without any consequences. James is disgusted at him for his scheming and conspiring and says he crossed a line, but Rawlins says that if she hands him over to Homeland Security, he will simply take her down with him. She eventually agrees to allow Russo to take the fall, but says that this will be their last time working together, saying he disgusts her.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP111"/>

**Frank Castle and [[David Lieberman]] wait at an agreed place and time. Castle promises that he will ensure Sarah and Zach are kept safe, but tells David to make sure that whatever happens, and, however, distracted he might be by seeing his family again, he sticks to the plan. Rawlins' men deliver Sarah and Zach Lieberman to the meeting point and take the bags off their heads, and they are confused and scared but delighted at seeing David alive. The deal begins, with Castle and David walking towards Rawlins' men as Sarah and Zach walk to them, forced to wear leaking tanks of petrol that leaves a trail that Rawlins' men can ignite if Castle or David break the deal.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP112"/>

*Castle is woken by [[Billy Russo]] in [[Micro's Hideout|Micro's hideout]], strapped to a chair. Russo asks him why Homeland Security were present, but he claims he does not know, pointing out that he would not want Russo arrested, as he wants to kill him personally. Russo laughs at him, saying that the only choice Castle has left is to choose how he dies. He says he will give him an easier death if Castle explains how to get into the computers, but Castle replies that he should just ask Lieberman. At that point, Russo tells him that Lieberman died in the deal. He points out that it was Homeland's bullets, not his, but Castle then asks about his family instead, questioning whether Russo was the one who killed them. His old friend tells him that he was not there, saying that if he was, then Castle would also be dead, but he admits that he knew it was going to happen. Castle is disgusted, reminding Russo that his family had loved Russo, and Russo replies that he would not have wanted things to go the way they did, but that it was just necessary after Cerberus was exposed. Castle threatens to kill him again, saying that Russo's threat against his life is meaningless as there are much worse things than death, and he has wanted to die for a long time.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP112"/>

Rawlins then dons a pair of gloves and starts beating Castle, who is unable to retaliate due to being tied up.

She lightly kisses him, then asks where [[Frank Castle]] is, and David reveals that he wanted himself to get kidnapped so he can get the chance to try to kill [[Billy Russo]] and his men, unless they kill him first. Sarah says that she hopes he does it, as the men deserve to go to hell. Madani enters, however, saying that he is likely being tortured and/or killed because they do not know where he is, confronting David about the fact that the tracker he was supposed to carry has been left behind in the van.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP112"/>
*Madani shows David Lieberman that they found the tracker and that this means Castle broke the deal, which involved him being kidnapped so he could lead them to Rawlins and Russo. She asks if he knew about Castle's decision to break the plan and he explains that he had to cover for him because he owed him, not Homeland Security, and feels that they still held up their half of the deal. She asks him if he knew Castle killed [[Ahmad Zubair]], saying that their talk of honor is meaningless when Castle was willing to murder like that. Lieberman, however, explains that Castle knows how awful that and his subsequent actions was and have been, saying it haunts him every day, and that the reason he is resigned to die is because he does not know that he deserves to live. Lieberman remarks that this is a true shame, and in reply Madani requests again that if he thinks Castle's death would be a shame then he should tell them where he is.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP112"/>
*Russo wakes Castle again, who is a bloody mess and barely conscious. He begins taunting Castle, saying his family, [[Gunner Henderson]], and David Lieberman are all dead because of him. He attempts to convince Castle, who is coming across as is barely clinging to life, to give up, telling him it is best to go out as a soldier. Castle begins to mumble, pretending that he is desperate and giving in and telling them to unlock the computers, he needs to type it in and give them a retinal scan, on the proviso that Russo be the one to kill him. Russo promises he will, and they take him over to the computers to do so. He unlocks them as promised, though, unbeknown to the others, secret cameras in the ceiling that Castle and Micro set up as a trap are triggered by the unlock to start recording. With his right hand having been freed to type, Castle then slips a hand under the chair where there is a hidden knife taped to the seat and he draws it out, turning and stabbing [[William Rawlins]] in the upper chest then viciously biting him on the back of his neck. Russo hits him with the hilt of his gun, allowing Rawlins to break free and kick Castle in the head. He again falls unconscious and dreams of [[Maria Castle|Maria]].<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP112"/>
[[File:RussoPunisher-GunToHead-Home.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Billy Russo]] threatens to execute the [[Punisher]]]]
*The computer expert [[Billy Russo]] has hired to help them goes through Micro's computer to delete the evidence on him and Rawlins. Rawlins, meanwhile, having tied Castle back to the chair, resumes beating him, shouting that he will make him feel deep pain and fear and beg for death. However, Russo then steps in and says that he needs to stop, because he had promised Castle that once they have wiped all the evidence, he would be the one to kill him. Enraged, however, Rawlins says that he does not care about the promise because Castle took everything from him.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP112"/>
*[[David Lieberman]] makes the decision to help [[Dinah Madani]] and urgently enters her office and requests to use her computer. He logs in and tells her about the truth behind their plan, having made sure that Russo and Rawlins would have to take [[Frank Castle]] to one specific place - the hideout - and that they set up the trap to secretly record the room so that they would have sufficient evidence to take down both men. He then desperately asks her for Homeland to go to the hideout and save Castle before it is too late.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP112"/>
*Rawlins continues to torment Castle, but Russo eventually has enough, pulling him away. Rawlins shouts to him that he serves him, and Russo says he has lost his mind, pointing out that he was clean coming out of [[Afghanistan]] but Rawlins had pulled him back into dirty work. Rawlins yells that he has control over Russo's record, attempting to put him in his place, and Russo angrily tells him that he should have let Castle kill him in [[Kandahar]]. Russo holds his gun to Castle's head, and Rawlins threatens him with his own gun, saying that Russo shall not deny him this kill. However, Russo uses the opportunity to subtly clip the ties around Castle's hands, wanting him to kill Rawlins for him. He then pretends to give up, stepping away and seemingly letting Rawlins continue to attack Castle.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP112"/>
[[File:WilliamRawlinsDeath.png|thumb|230px|[[Frank Castle]] brutally kills [[William Rawlins]]]]
*Castle dreams of Maria one more time, telling him to make the choice of whether he wants to give in or keep fighting. [[William Rawlins]] injects Castle with adrenaline, telling him he wants him to be awake for the final minutes of torture. The woman working at the computers finishes erasing the evidence and Russo has the other men present escort her out, leaving only him, Rawlins, and Castle in the room together. As Rawlins moves his knife in towards his face to kill him, Castle, thinking of Maria, finds the drive to summon the energy and fight back, headbutting Rawlins and getting up from the chair Rawlins had not realized he was no longer tied to. He kicks the man to the ground and stands over him, taking his own knife and stabbing him repeatedly in the neck before pummelling him in the face and shouting at him to die. He finishes him off by pushing his thumbs into Rawlins' eyes and cracking his skull, finally ending his mission of revenge against the former Agent Orange.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP112"/>
*[[Billy Russo]], who has happily observed the whole fight, sadistically tells Castle that he loves to watch him work. Castle lies on the ground, on death's door, but still manages to laugh at his old friend, telling him he wishes he could see his face when he realizes he is finished. Russo complacently tells him that he can easily cover the fact that he was ever there, but Castle knows better and chuckles as he hears Homeland Security arrive. Russo lifts his gun to kill his old friend but is shot in the arm and forced to run to get away. [[David Lieberman]] rushes to Castle's side and desperately calls at him to stay conscious and live. He eventually manages to splutter and draw some breath, affirming to himself that he has finally come to the understanding that he is "home" in the world of the living.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP112"/>
*Lieberman and [[Dinah Madani]] carry [[Frank Castle]] out of the hideout.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP113"/>
*Dinah takes Castle to her father, [[Hamid Madani]], who is a doctor, unable to get him to the hospital as they might have him arrested. [[Farah Madani]] is reluctant to help a man many would consider a terrorist, but Hamid trusts his daughter's judgement. He realizes that one of Castle's broken ribs has punctured his lung and successfully manages to use a syringe to drain the blood out of the punctured lung, saving his life.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP113"/>

*'''[[Ambush on Billy Russo]]''': Russo gets back to [[Anvil Headquarters]] and removes the bullet from his shoulder. He then realizes that Homeland Security agents have followed him and are in the building. Using his knowledge of the building's layout, he maneuvers the headquarters to take out each agent with a single gun, then he escapes to go after Castle again and blows up the building behind him.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP113"/>

*Hamid Madani explains that he has tended to Castle as much as he can for now, and that at this point, his recovery is simply a matter of time. Castle asks Dinah about Russo, but she sadly informs him he got away.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP113"/>
*[[Rafael Hernandez]] and [[Marion James]] collect [[William Rawlins]]' dead body from the crime scene.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP113"/>
*David Lieberman hands Castle money he has stolen from bad people by hacking, telling him to use the money to get out of the city, but he insists that he has to finish matters with [[Billy Russo]]. He dresses and thanks Dinah Madani for her help, and Madani tells him that she will let him go, but that after this, if she sees him again then she will treat him as a criminal as she should. He accepts this and leaves.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP113"/>
*Back at [[Homeland Security Headquarters]], Madani has a meeting with Hernandez and James, in which Hernandez tells her that he has worked out that she let Castle and Lieberman go. She responds by highlighting the accusations she could easily make against James in return and says that she did the right thing, because if either of them were in custody, the story they could tell would have the potential of ruining the [[CIA]]'s reputation.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP113"/>
*The Lieberman family wait for David in a safe house, and he is taken to reunite with them. He tells [[Sarah Lieberman|Sarah]] that he hopes the family can function together again, albeit after an adjustment period, and informs her that Castle is alive but gone.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP113"/>
*'''[[Attack on Curtis Hoyle]]''':
[[File:BillyWakesUpCurtis.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Billy Russo]] reveals himself to [[Curtis Hoyle]]]]
**[[Curtis Hoyle]] wakes and realizes there is an attacker in his room. He reaches for the gun he keeps by his bed, but finds it gone, turning to see [[Billy Russo]] sitting, holding it. Russo is not overtly threatening to Hoyle, allowing him to put on his prosthetic leg, but starts to question him, asking how long he had known [[Frank Castle]] was alive and saying he feels betrayed by another friend for having been lied to.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP113"/>
**Hoyle takes Russo to his living room, explaining that he kept Castle's secret because Castle had asked him to, and that he would have done the same for Russo. Russo says that none of them needed to be in this situation if not for Castle's interference, and that if anything, Castle should be blamed. Hoyle refuses to listen, but Russo continues, claiming that [[Operation Cerberus]] was not particularly bad, as the drugs would have arrived anyway and the Afghans were killing each other so their murders made no particular difference.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP113"/>
**Russo gets to the point of his visit, asking Hoyle where Castle is, as Hoyle opens the curtains. Before responding, Hoyle lures Russo in front of one of the windows by offering him a coffee, and Castle, who is waiting on the roof of the next building, takes the opportunity Hoyle has given him to take a shot at Russo. Having guessed at the last second what Hoyle was doing, Russo manages to react fast enough to dodge the shot, and takes shots himself at Hoyle, catching him in the back and shoulder before he can dive for cover.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP113"/>
**Castle calls Hoyle and asks him to hand over the phone to Russo. Russo takes it and Castle tells him that since he has him cornered, he could call Homeland Security if necessary, unless Russo agrees to meet with him to finish things between them privately. Russo has Castle eject the magazine and cartridge from his rifle to allow him to get away, then agrees to his terms, telling him to meet at midnight at the [[Central Park]] carousel, where Castle's family were [[Massacre at Central Park|killed]]. He throws Hoyle back his phone to call himself an ambulance and leaves.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP113"/>
*Castle is distressed by the idea of returning to the carousel and recalls a time he and his family had been at the park a [[2013|few years prior]] with Russo. He remembers how Russo had been kind and loving to all of them, feeling intensely betrayed.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP113"/>

*'''[[Chase of Quake]]''': Coulson and Mackenzie notice Johnson and run to chase her. Johnson realizes that S.H.I.E.L.D. has found her and walks away to evade them, using her vibrational powers to lift herself off the ground in a very high jump onto a nearby roof, escaping successfully.

*'''[[Duel at the Central Park Carousel]]''':
[[File:Punisher-WoodsPhoneCall.jpg|thumb|255px|The [[Punisher]] prepares to fight against [[Billy Russo]]]]
**At midnight, Billy Russo activates the carousel, causing Castle to recall his family's deaths once again. Compartmentalizing the thought to stay level-headed, he continues to advance, but suddenly notices that two teenagers are strapped to the horses. Russo calls him and tells him that the teenagers, Carl and Hayley, are bleeding out, and if he does not act soon, they will die.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP113"/>
**Castle uses a small grenade launcher to fires grenades over the carousel and land them on the other side, distracting Russo briefly with the small explosions and thus allowing him to run at his old friend. The gunfight between them begins, with both running for cover. Russo hits Castle in the leg, but he straps up the wound to stop the bleeding.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP113"/>
**Madani drives to Central Park and closes in on the carousel.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP113"/>
**Castle limps back out from his cover and jumps onto the carousel, with Russo getting on the other side. As Russo jeers at him, they both try to judge which side the other is walking out from. Castle uses the mirrors of the carousel to work out where Russo is hiding and shoots at him. Russo shoots back, only managing to him in his vest and wind him, but Castle gets the more severe hit as he shoots Russo through the cheek.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP113"/>
**[[Billy Russo]] threatens the lives of [[Carl (Central Park)|Carl]] and [[Hayley]], telling Castle he will shoot them if he does not come out from where he is hiding. He cautiously and reluctantly walks out, throwing away his gun and knife on Russo's demand. [[Dinah Madani]], meanwhile, makes her way to the carousel. Russo begins taunting Castle, telling him he always cared too much and that this has ultimately been his downfall, in giving himself up for the teenagers, punctuating his words with shots to Castle's vest to keep him down as he closes in for the kill.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP113"/>
**Madani gets onto the carousel but Carl asks her for help, revealing her presence to Russo, who turns and immediately shoots her in the side of the head. [[Frank Castle]] takes advantage of the momentary distraction, however, and tackles Russo, engaging him in a hand-to-hand fight. Russo pulls out a knife, but Castle knocks it out of his hand, then pushing it in towards his old friend's face.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP113"/>
[[File:BillyRusso-KnifeFight-Carousel.jpg|thumb|255px|[[Billy Russo]] draws his [[Billy Russo's Hidden Blade|hidden blade]] to attack the [[Punisher]]]]
**Russo pushes back and then extends the [[Billy Russo's Hidden Blade|hidden blade]] in his sleeve through Castle's forearm, loosening Castle's grip and allowing him to reclaim his knife. They continue to fight, but Russo starts to win, shoving Castle against one of the carousel's mirrors and preparing again to kill him. Castle, however, picks up a shard of the mirror from the ground and uses it to stab Russo in the gut, who finds himself barely able to stand.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP113"/>
[[File:Frank defeating Russo.jpg|thumb|255px|The [[Punisher]] defeating [[Billy Russo]]]]
**Castle grabs Russo and throws him into the next carousel mirror, cracking it. He then shoves his face into the glass and scrapes it across the cracks, grating Russo's face across the sharp shards and cutting his cheek into a bloody mess. Russo feebly attempts to fight back one last time, but Castle breaks his arm and throws him head-first into the next mirror. His enemy brought to his knees, Castle walks over and holds a knife to Russo's throat.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP113"/>
[[File:Memento Mori pic.png|thumb|255px|The [[Punisher]] brutally disfigures [[Billy Russo]]'s face]]
**Russo begs for Castle to kill him, but Castle decides not to, saying that dying is the easy way out. He tells Russo that he wants him to learn about pain and loss the way he has had to after Russo helped orchestrate his family's deaths. He repeatedly smashes Russo's face into the glass as he tells him that every day he will have to look at his mangled face in the mirror and remember everything he ever did wrong, keeping going until Russo falls to the ground, comatose, with shards of the mirror lodged in his face.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP113"/>

*3 days after the [[Duel at the Central Park Carousel|duel at the Central Park carousel]], [[Frank Castle]] is taken to see [[Rafael Hernandez]] and [[Marion James]] in Madani's hospital room. Madani is recovering from the bullet wound to her head, and he thanks her for saving his life. James and Hernandez tell him that they need him to stay quiet, and in return, while he is officially still at large, they have replaced his fingerprints and DNA samples in the system with those of a dead man and are giving him freedom under the identity of Pete Castiglione in repayment for what he has done for the country in exposing and taking down [[Operation Cerberus]]. He asks why they did not just have him killed, but they explain that these terms were what Madani requested for him. Castle then enquires what has happened to [[Billy Russo]], and Hernandez says that he is still in a coma and they are unsure if and when he might wake, or that if he does, how much brain function he could have or regain. Madani says that she hopes Russo remembers everything, so that he knows she played her part in taking him down.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP113"/>
*[[David Lieberman]] returns [[Lieberman Residence|home]] for the first time in over a year, to join his family for a turkey lunch to celebrate the holidays.

*Castle visits [[Curtis Hoyle]], having agreed to join him for one of his veteran meetings. He sits with the other veterans and takes his turn to speak, telling them that while he was at war, he never considered what life would be like after he got back home. He says that the silence after coming home is hard to come to terms with, but admits that really, he has still been in a personal war since returning. Castle states that now, for the first time in as long as he can remember, he does not have a war to fight, and confesses that if he is honest with himself, without it, he has to admit he feels scared.<ref name="TP1 Late 2016 Placement"/><ref name="TP113"/>
