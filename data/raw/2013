This is a timeline of events that occurred in 2013.

==2013==
===January===
====6th====
*In a therapy session, [[Tony Stark]] recounts the events of [[Aldrich Killian's War]] to [[Bruce Banner]], but after he finishes his story, he realizes Banner has fallen asleep.<ref name="IM3">''[[Iron Man 3]]''</ref>

====12th====
*[[Ghost]] kills a man who shoots at her on a mission for [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], under the promise that in return, S.H.I.E.L.D. will help find her a cure to her molecular disequilibrium.<ref>In ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]'', several moments are shown from Ava Starr's past at S.H.I.E.L.D.. Hannah John-Kamen was 28.05 at the middle of filming and should not be playing Starr at an age any younger than â…” of her actual age, so 18.70, meaning, based on Starr's approximated date of birth (see [[1980s]] references), that the scenes should be after April 26, 2007. One moment appears to say [https://i2.wp.com/caps.pictures/201/7-antman-wasp/full/antman-wasp-movie-screencaps.com-5634.jpg?strip=all "01-8 Thu"], suggesting it is Thursday, January 8, 2009. Evenly distributing between these two dates, the first set of scenes should be approximately September 29, 2007, March 4, 2008, and August 7, 2008, before then January 8, 2009. Then after that, the remaining scenes are between then and the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D. on January 12, 2014 (see [[2014]] references). Evenly distributing again, the remaining scenes should be January 9, 2010, January 11, 2011, January 12, 2012, and January 12, 2013.</ref><ref>''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]''</ref>

===April===
====2nd====
*Now partnering with [[Groot]], [[Rocket Raccoon]] arrives at [[Hub (Space Station)|Hub]] without money and desperate for a job in order to buy fuel for their vehicle.<ref name="GotGP"/>
*[[File:GotGP Rocket 2.PNG|thumb|270px|[[Rocket Raccoon]] and [[Groot]] betray and fight [[Zade Scraggot]]'s men]]Fortunately, they are hired by [[Sqqd'li]], under the orders of his employer the crime-lord [[Zade Scraggot]], in order to retrieve a package being held in the highly secure "Uptown" section of the station for [[Units|1000 Credits]]. Rocket and [[Groot]] successfully retrieve the package, but upon discovering that the package contains a family of sentient [[Scalluscs]], a snail-like creature that Scraggot was planning on harvesting for their shells (and upon learning that the Scalluscs have money and could double Scraggot's pay), Rocket and Groot rescues them from their cruel fate after a brief scuffle with [[Zade Scraggot]] and his men.<ref name="GotGP">''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Prelude]]''</ref>

====23rd====
*Working at the [[Brooklyn Suicide Prevention Center]], [[Benjamin Poindexter]] gets a call from someone named Craig. He starts following the hotline script he has been given, and is pleased when the coworker he has become obsessed with, [[Julie Barnes]], walks by and tells him he is doing amazingly. Once she is gone, however, Poindexter abandons the script. He becomes interested in Craig's gun, and starts to suggest that instead of taking his own life, Craig perhaps consider instead killing his stepfather causing him his pain. Before he can finish, however, Barnes passes again, and Poindexter reverts to the script.<ref>In ''[[The Perfect Game]]'', a flashback is shown of Benjamin Poindexter and Julie Barnes at the Brooklyn Suicide Prevention Center. They look the same age as in 2017, so it can be assumed to be not long before the present events. Poindexter is a special agent at the FBI, so his work at the hotline can be taken to have ended at least 4 years prior. It is presumably not much longer ago than that, however, given their appearances. It is seemingly some time into his time working there, since he has become fixated on Barnes, but not too long given the way she encourages him and how he comes across. It can be assumed, therefore, to be approximately in the middle of his "1 [year]" (stated in ''The Perfect Game'') there. Being a special agent by October 23, 2017 (see [[2017]] references), the scene can therefore be placed about 4.5 years prior, around April 23, 2013.</ref><ref>''[[The Perfect Game|Daredevil: 3.05: The Perfect Game]]''</ref>

===May===
*''{{WPS|Ezekiel "Easy" Rawlins#Little Green, 2013|Little Green}}'' is published.<ref name="Real Events">Sometimes the ''[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]'' alludes to events which happened in our world, and it is assumed they happened on the same dates in the universe, for timeline purposes.</ref><ref name="LC102">''[[Code of the Streets|Luke Cage: 1.02: Code of the Streets]]''</ref>
*[[Amy Minoru]] is given an athletics award.<ref>''[[Reunion (Runaways)|Runaways: 1.01: Reunion]]''</ref>

====18th====
*[[Joy Meachum]] earns her {{WPS|Juris Doctor}} degree from [[Columbia University]].<ref>''[[Snow Gives Way|Iron Fist: 1.01: Snow Gives Way]]''</ref>

===June===
====30th====
*[[Cybertek|Cybertek Technologies]] finishes the construction of the [[Cybertek Prosthetic Leg]], as part of [[Project Deathlok]].<ref name="AoS113">''[[T.R.A.C.K.S.|Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 1.13: T.R.A.C.K.S.]]''</ref>
*Despite insisting that he did not commit the crime, [[Carl Lucas]] receives a long sentence in [[Seagate Prison]]. Unbeknownst to him, he was set up by [[Willis Stryker]].<ref name="LC104 Flashbacks">In ''[[Step in the Arena]]'', Carl Lucas/Luke Cage's hair growth would suggest approximately 4 months between his first day and nearly attacking Comanche in the courtyard, and a further 2 months between then and Squabbles being killed and Lucas/Cage being attacked again, with his escape the next day. This all takes place before January 20, 2014, the firm date for when Reva Connors is killed (see [[2014]] references). Ideally, it would be a good few months at least before her death. However, in ''[[Can't Front on Me]]'', Shades says, "My last year in Seagate, me and Comanche got paid by this juiced-in-guard, Rackham, to beat the shit out of some guy named Carl Lucas." In ''[[Code of the Streets]]'', in November 2015 (see [[2015]] references), Shades says, "I just got home [...] Three years this time, Seagate," suggesting he was released in late 2015, so his "last year in Seagate" would start in late 2014, but Cage is already out and Connors is already dead by then. If Shades is taken to be very loosely meaning "just" when he says "just got home", you could maybe take it that he got home a little earlier in 2015, but still, this does not work, with Cage escaping absolutely no later than January 2014. At a stretch, it can be taken that Shades is referring to the calendar year of 2014 as his last year at Seagate, released in the first half of 2015, so only a few months in and with 2015 not counting as his last "year" - and he is also only meaning "just" loosely, back for about half a year. With this, it would mean that his second attack on Lucas/Cage, the attack that he is referring to, can be in January 2014 and still loosely fit his statement. However, with Connors killed on January 20, 2014, this is very late for Lucas/Cage's escape. At an absolute minimum, they spend a few weeks together after the escape and before her death. So, all things considered, the attack can be dated to January 1, 2014, just about fitting Shades' statement at a stretch, and allowing Cage and Connors 18 days (2nd-20th), as much as possible, living freely together before her death. This makes Lucas/Cage nearly attacking Comanche roughly November 1, 2013, and his first day at Seagate roughly July 1, 2013, based on hair growth. The rest of the flashbacks in ''Step in the Arena'' are placed between July 2013 and January 2014 accordingly.</ref><ref name="LC104">''[[Step in the Arena|Luke Cage: 1.04: Step in the Arena]]''</ref>

===July===
====1st====
[[File:Cage enters Seagate.JPG|thumb|250px|Lucas begins his sentence at [[Seagate Prison]]]]
*During his first day, Lucas meets [[Albert Rackham]], who starts to shown an interest in Lucas. Lucas mocks Rackham, and Rackham punches him in the gut, taunting him about how he used to be a sheriff. Rackham then sends Lucas, as well as the other prisoners, back to their cells. Lucas spends the rest of the night saying his name over and over to remember who he is, and to get through prison time.<ref name="LC104 Flashbacks"/><ref name="LC104"/>

====11th====

====23rd====
*[[James Lucas|James]] and [[Etta Lucas]] visit their son, [[Carl Lucas]], in [[Seagate Penitentiary]]. James blames the stress of Carl's incarceration for Etta's diminishing health and has them leave prematurely, and Carl would never see Etta again.<ref>The flashback in ''[[On and On]]'' of Luke Cage being visited by his parents in prison appears to take place between his arrival and his first intervention in ''[[Step in the Arena]]''. With these scenes dated to July 1, 2013 and August 14, 2013 respectively (see other references), the visit can be approximated to the midpoint between these dates, July 23, 2013.</ref><ref>''[[On and On|Luke Cage: 2.07: On and On]]''</ref>

====28th====
*[[Chico Diaz]] puts his initials "CD" on the St. Nick basketball court.<ref name="LC102"/>

===August===
*[[File:Pwzcofjtc3u03ronweuq.jpg|thumb|255px|Nelson and Murdock at [[Landman and Zack]]]]Having been working as interns at the law firm [[Landman and Zack]], [[Matt Murdock]] and [[Foggy Nelson]] are offered permanent jobs at the firm. Nelson shows great enthusiasm about the offer, but Murdock believes that working for such a soulless company is not the right direction for them to go in. Murdock manages to convince the skeptical Nelson not to take the job offer and instead they come up with the idea to start up [[Nelson and Murdock|their own law firm]] where they can really help innocent people and make a difference to their city.<ref name="DD110"/>
*[[Matt Murdock]] has trouble sleeping due to one of his neighbor's daughter crying as her father is abusing her. Murdock contacts the police to have him arrested; however, the man is able to get away with the crime as his wife claims he never committed the crime and his daughter does not reveal the truth.<ref name="DD110"/>
*The next night, seeing that the man would not face justice, Murdock dons a black eyeless mask and goes after the man. He manages to find him at the train yard where he works. Murdock severely beats him up and threatens that if he ever touches his daughter again, he would find him and possibly kill him. The man would spend the next month in the hospital, while Murdock would consider more acts of vigilantism.<ref name="DD110">''[[Nelson v. Murdock|Daredevil: 1.10: Nelson v. Murdock]]''</ref>

===September===
====1st====
[[File:FCastleInCentralParkWithWife.jpg|thumb|250px|Castle spends time with his family in Central Park]]
*[[Frank Castle|Frank]], [[Maria Castle|Maria]], [[Frank Castle, Jr.|Frank Jr.]], and [[Lisa Castle]] go to the [[Central Park]] carousel with family friend [[Billy Russo]]. Russo begins to joke with the children and tells the story of the outlaw "Billy the Kid", who he claims he was named after. Lisa notes that since he is an orphan, he cannot know who he was named after, and he laughs at his mistake. Maria happily reminds him that they are all his family now.<ref name="TP1 Castle Family Flashbacks">In ''[[3 AM]]'' and ''[[Two Dead Men]]'', flashbacks are shown of Frank Castle spending time with his children some time before their deaths. As mentioned in ''[[Penny and Dime]]'', his family were killed the day after he got back from a rotation, which is said in ''[[Home]]'' to have been Operation Cerberus in Kandahar. Therefore, these scenes cannot be between his return and their deaths, so must be before Castle left for Kandahar, which is dated to September 14, 2013 (see other references). There is a further scene in ''[[Memento Mori]]'' with the family spending time with Billy Russo at the Central Park carousel, which does not present clearly whether it is the day of the family's deaths or a previous time. However, Maria and Frank Jr.'s clothes are different in this scene than when they are shown on the day of their death in later flashbacks in ''Memento Mori'', suggesting it is a different day and therefore before Kandahar. As well as this, Russo says in ''[[Virtue of the Vicious]]'' on December 12, 2016 that he has not seen Castle for a "couple years now". As he wants to cover up the fact that he has recently spoken with Castle, he is saying that the last time that he had seen Castle before the last month is in fact the last time he had seen him, therefore meaning that the last time Castle and Russo saw each other was late 2014, so the ''Memento Mori'' scene cannot be in 2015. Finally, in ''3 AM'', it is shown that Maria Castle woke Frank at 10:30 on the day of their deaths, and in ''[[Kinbaku]]'' it is said that the massacre was at midday, so there would not be the time for them to get ready, go to Central Park, have Russo join them for a chunk of time, then have Russo leave before midday.<br>So, these three scenes all take place before the Kandahar deployment, which began on September 14, 2013 (see other references). However, both children look the same as they do in April 2015 (due to the scenes being filmed at the same time), so it can be assumed that they took place in the weeks preceding the Kandahar placement, to get them as close as possible to 2015. Castle has a buzz cut in the ''3 AM'' and ''Two Dead Men'' scenes but longer hair in the ''Memento Mori'' scene. The military buzz cut is likely shortly after or shortly before a deployment, and since, as explained, the scenes should be as late as possible (Summer 2013) and not as far back as 2012 (when Castle got back from his last deployment), the ''Memento Mori'' scene should therefore be placed preceding the other two, before Castle shaved his head ahead of his deployment. It can finally be reasoned that the ''3 AM'' and ''Memento Mori'' scenes take place around the weekend before September 14, 2013, September 7-8, 2013, and the ''Memento Mori'' scene approximated as the weekend before, around September 1, 2013.</ref><ref>''[[Memento Mori|The Punisher: 1.13: Memento Mori]]''</ref>

The date of the bus crash incident which ended their time together is definitively shown in ''[[AKA Crush Syndrome]]'' to be "January 20, 2014", and they were together for a few months, meaning they cannot have realistically met any later than September 2013. In ''[[AKA Sin Bin]]'', Kilgrave says "it was a cold, clear night" when he met Jones, meaning it could not be realistically earlier than September 2013. The reasoned date for this onscreen writing is March 25, 2015, and 18 months prior to this is September 2013, which works well for the dates both ways.</ref>

*Connors tries to get as many inmates as possible to change, by having them tell how they ended up in prison in the first place.

*[[Frank Castle]] and [[Billy Russo]] begin a 15-month deployment in [[Kandahar]], [[Afghanistan]], assigned to a squad known as [[Operation Cerberus]]. Unbeknown to Castle, it is a corrupt assassination program funded by illegal heroin operations, and Russo himself, Castle's best friend, is helping the men leading it in secret.<ref name="TP1 Kandahar Flashbacks">In ''[[Kandahar (episode)|Kandahar]]'', it is shown that on Frank Castle's birthday, November 15th (see [[1970s#1976|1976]] references), there are "29 days" supposed to be remaining of their deployment. Therefore, they are due to finish on December 14th. In ''[[Home]]'', when Madani questions Castle about Kandahar, she asks, "You served many years as a Marine Force Recon?" He replies, "I did." She asks, "But that isn't where you served your last mission?", and Castle affirms, "No. I was part of a covert CIA operation. It was called Cerberus." Therefore, Kandahar was Castle's final deployment. However, in ''[[Kinbaku]]'', Ellison's statements firmly place the Massacre at Central Park on April 4, 2015 (see [[2015]] references), and in ''[[Penny and Dime]]'', Castle explains that this was the day after he got back from his final deployment. It must therefore be assumed that after Castle attacked William Rawlins on November 16th, similarly to how Russo "requested a transfer back to Force", Castle either requested to move or was forced to for his damaging attack on a superior officer, and had to serve an extra few months before finishing on April 3, 2015. This therefore makes the November that the Kandahar events take place November 2014.<br>In ''[[Crosshairs]]'', Frank Castle says "we did 15-month rotations in Afghanistan". Since they were due to finish on December 14, 2014, it can therefore be assumed that the deployment began around September 14, 2013. This also aligns with the fact that Castle says on November 15, 2014, "We have been doing it for a year," as it would have been 14 months.<br>Finally, the assassination of Ahmad Zubair takes place somewhere between the September 14, 2013 start of the operation and the November 15, 2014 abrupt ending, so it can be approximated as roughly halfway between, around the night of April 15-16, 2014.</ref><ref name="TP103">''[[Kandahar (episode)|The Punisher: 1.03: Kandahar]]''</ref>
