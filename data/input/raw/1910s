====10th====
*[[Bucky Barnes|James Buchanan "Bucky" Barnes]] is born.<ref>The [[:File:SSR files 2.jpg|SSR files]] revealed at a USC event and used in a deleted scene from ''The Avengers'' show Barnes' date of birth to be March 10, 1922.<br>However, in ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'', the section on Barnes in the Smithsonian reads [[:File:Bucky's bio - TWS.png|"Born in 1916..."]], and finishes with "1917-1944". The fact that these dates have actually appeared in the films make them more important. The 1917 date is the most fitting date to select, as it is the median of the 3 years, and because the "1917-1944" dates are already one year off with his date of death, which is said by Zola later in the film, and Sam Wilson in ''Captain America: Civil War'', to have been in "1945", it is unlikely they would be two off. The assumption can be made that the error has come from the author knowing that Barnes died at age 27, and so adding 27 to his year of birth, 1917, not realising he only "died" a short while for his 28th birthday. As with Peggy Carter, where her file claimed she was born on April 9, 1919, but ''[[Emancipation]]'' established that it was April 9, 1921 instead, it can be taken that Barnes' SSR file also contains the correct date, but incorrect year of birth, therefore meaning he was born on March 10, 1917.</ref><ref name="CATWS">''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]''</ref><ref>[[:File:SSR files 2.jpg|SSR file on Barnes with the correct date, but wrong year of birth (as with Peggy Carter)]]</ref>
