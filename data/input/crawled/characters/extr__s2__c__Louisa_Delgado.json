      "November 2015<ref>The Attack on the Hand cannot be much longer than a month before Christmas, December 25th, as Murdock still has cuts and bruises from the battle then, so at the earliest it is mid-November, and Delgado's death is 3 nights before that, so at the earliest it is November. However, ''Just to Get a Rep'' has to be after this event. ''DWYCK'' shows the date to be December 1st, and ''Just to Get a Rep'' is a while before that, so at the latest as well this is November.</ref>"
