=====Dark Dimension=====
* [[Alex Wilder]], [[Tina Minoru]], [[Stacey Yorkes]], and [[Victor Stein]] appear in the Hostel, where they talk to [[Quinton the Great]]. Against his advice, the group goes outside and ends up in their worst memories. Minoru goes to the day her daughter died, Yorkes to the day her daughter discovered her experiments with a dinosaur, Stein to a day when his father was beating him, and Wilder to an alternate world where he is in prison.<ref>In [[Enter The Dreamland|''Enter The Dreamland'']]'', the Runaways go to the Dark Dimension, and reappear on Earth six months later, although for they didn't notice the time pass. This implies a time dilation, and therefore should be included separately from the rest of the timeline.''</ref>
* [[Nico Minoru]] and [[Karolina Dean]] wake up to old fashioned music playing in the [[Hostel]]. They meet [[Chase Stein]], [[Molly Hernandez]], and [[Gert Yorkes]] in the main area, where they witness a party full of people dressed like the 1920s. They speculate as to what is happening.
* They find [[Quinton the Great]], who tries to get them to watch a magic show, and they discover that none of them have their powers. Quinton warns them against leaving the Hostel, and storms off.
* The Runaways follow him and ask for help. Quinton tells the Runaways that he's seen the former hosts of the Gibborim, who went outside. Quinton tells them that where they are, the Dark Dimension, is a thin place between other dimension, and that their friends are trapped in a moment that tortures them. They leave the Hostel and the Dark Dimensions separates them.
* Minoru appears in a hill, where she sees [[Akari Minoru|Akari]], [[Tokiko Minoru|Tokiko]], and [[Judith Minoru]], her grandmother and aunts. She talks to them about the [[Staff of One]]. Her relatives don't trust her with it, and they discuss the Staff's new ability to enter her chest. They try to cut her open, but [[Amy Minoru]] appears and stops them. They appear in the [[Minoru Mansion]], where Nico finds Tina standing over Amy's corpse. An illusion of Nico walks out of Amy's room, and is comforted by an illusion of [[Robert Minoru]]. Tina tries to resurrect "Amy," but can't remember the spell. She hands Nico the Staff of One, and she uses it to stab "Amy," causing her to disappear. She convinces Tina that their not in the real world, and Tina resolves to leave with Nico. They try to find the real Amy, who has disappeared. They go to the garage to get a car.
* Stein appears in a street, where he witnesses [[Victor Stein]] being abused by his father, [[Curtis Stein]]. Chase runs over to the car and is confronted by Curtis, leading to a chase. Chase outruns Curtis and returns to his father. He tries to drive away, but the car doesn't work, so Victor and Chase fight Curtis off together. Chase gets carried away, and Victor stops him, hoping to end the cycle of abuse in the Stein family. They run away together, looking for their friends.
* Dean appears in an encampment, where she is met by [[Destiny Gonzalez]] and the other victims of the [[Rite of Blood]]. It starts to get dark, and Gonzalez asks her for help from the monster who always comes to them in the dark. The group ties Dean to a fence, and a monster, who looks like Nico Minoru chained to the Magistrate's corpse, attacks the camp. The monster tries to kiss her, but Dean refuses and tricks her into untying her. Dean the gets a crowbar and separates the chain, untethering the monster from the corpse. Dean flees, and starts hearing Minoru's voice. She appears in a town square, where she reunites with the real Nico and Tina.
* Hernandez appears in her childhood home, in a time when she is still four years old and being offered breakfast by her parents. Molly notices a present left for her by [[Alice Hernandez]], the hair clip she treasures. Molly realizes this is because the Hernandezes never watched Molly grow up. Her parents tell them that they're going to do charity work at the [[Church of Gibborim]]. The Hernandezes serve fruit punch at the church, and they find potential [[Rite of Blood|sacrifice]] victims for the [[Magistrate]]. Molly confronts them about it, and they tell Molly that they are honored and proud to work for him. All of the kids in the room die from poisoned punch, and [[Gene Hernandez|Gene]] and Alice offer her punch. She runs out of the church and looks back in through the glass, to find the room empty.
* Yorkes appears in the basement of her [[Yorkes Residence|house]], where she wanders downstairs and discovers her mother experimenting on a prototype version of [[Old Lace]]. Proto-Old Lace bangs against the door of her cage, scaring Yorkes, and [[Stacey Yorkes]] turns the lights on. Stacey prepared the [[Synnergy Serum]] to use on Gert, as she realized it really happened, and that it was both of their nightmare. Stacey injects Gert with the serum. Some time later, Gert wakes up to her mother still experimenting, realizing what happened. Gert realizes that this was the cause of her anxiety disorder. Stacey tries to defend herself, and she asks Gert to prove herself by feeding the prototype dinosaur. She enters the cage with a raw chicken, successfully feeds her, but gets attacked. Stacey shoots the dinosaur with a tranquilizer, Gert escapes, and they are met by Chase and Victor.
* The Steins and Yorkeses drive, and discover corpses hanging off of buildings.
* Dean and the Minoru's discover Molly, and they are rejoined by the Steins and Yorkeses. Hernandez doesn't recognize Stacey, and everyone realizes that [[Quinton the Great]] was right about them losing their memories. They leave Wilder behind and return to the [[Hostel]].
* Amy reunites with them and tells them that she is an emissary of [[Morgan le Fay]]. Tina and Nico cast a spell to create a portal to Earth, and they all enter.
