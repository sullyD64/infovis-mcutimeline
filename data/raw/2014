[[File:Lucas avoids Conner.JPG|thumb|250px|Lucas talks to Connors]]
*Lucas watches TV in the lounge area of [[Seagate Prison]]. [[Reva Connors]] calls him to meet her in the other room for a quiet talk on their own. Shocked by all his cuts and bruises, Connors mentions that he has not been to the group in months, but he responds that plans have changed. Lucas notices that [[Noah Burstein]] is watching them and asks Connors about him, but she asks if he would like to talk about something. Lucas refuses, saying that if he speaks, something bad will happen to her.<ref name="LC104 Flashbacks">In ''[[Step in the Arena]]'', Carl Lucas/Luke Cage's hair growth would suggest approximately 4 months between his first day and nearly attacking Comanche in the courtyard, and a further 2 months between then and Squabbles being killed and Lucas/Cage being attacked again, with his escape the next day. This all takes place before January 20, 2014, the firm date for when Reva Connors is killed (see other references). Ideally, it would be a good few months at least before her death. However, in ''[[Can't Front on Me]]'', Shades says, "My last year in Seagate, me and Comanche got paid by this juiced-in-guard, Rackham, to beat the shit out of some guy named Carl Lucas." In ''[[Code of the Streets]]'', in November 2015 (see [[2015]] references), Shades says, "I just got home [...] Three years this time, Seagate," suggesting he was released in late 2015, so his "last year in Seagate" would start in late 2014, but Cage is already out and Connors is already dead by then. If Shades is taken to be very loosely meaning "just" when he says "just got home", you could maybe take it that he got home a little earlier in 2015, but still, this does not work, with Cage escaping absolutely no later than January 2014. At a stretch, it can be taken that Shades is referring to the calendar year of 2014 as his last year at Seagate, released in the first half of 2015, so only a few months in and with 2015 not counting as his last "year" - and he is also only meaning "just" loosely, back for about half a year. With this, it would mean that his second attack on Lucas/Cage, the attack that he is referring to, can be in January 2014 and still loosely fit his statement. However, with Connors killed on January 20, 2014, this is very late for Lucas/Cage's escape. At an absolute minimum, they spend a few weeks together after the escape and before her death. So, all things considered, the attack can be dated to January 1, 2014, just about fitting Shades' statement at a stretch, and allowing Cage and Connors 18 days (2nd-20th), as much as possible, living freely together before her death. This makes Lucas/Cage nearly attacking Comanche roughly November 1, 2013, and his first day at Seagate roughly July 1, 2013, based on hair growth. The rest of the flashbacks in ''Step in the Arena'' are placed between July 2013 and January 2014 accordingly.</ref><ref name="LC212">''[[Can't Front on Me|Luke Cage: 2.12: Can't Front on Me]]''</ref><ref name="LC104">''[[Step in the Arena|Luke Cage: 1.04: Step in the Arena]]''</ref>
*Connors leaves him, but Lucas notices that [[Shades]] approaches her. Rackham approaches behind and taunts him, causing Lucas to grab him by the scruff of the neck and violently slam him against the wall in rage. However, Rackham threatens that he now has another person to bargain with other than [[Squabbles]]. Fearing for the life of his friends, Lucas lets him go.<ref name="LC104 Flashbacks"/><ref name="LC104"/>
*Lucas comes up to Squabbles and tells him of the plan to expose Rackham. Squabbles agrees to the plan, but as Lucas leaves, Squabbles is approached by two of Rackham's men and is killed. A few minutes later, Lucas goes into his cell and is attacked by [[Shades]] and [[Comanche]], who are not happy about his decision to expose the arena.<ref name="LC104 Flashbacks"/><ref name="LC104"/><ref>''[[Can't Front on Me|Luke Cage: 2.12: Can't Front on Me]]''</ref>
*Lucas is sent to the infirmary, where [[Noah Burstein]] treats him.<ref name="LC104 Flashbacks"/><ref name="LC104"/>

====2nd====
*[[File:Injured Lucas.JPG|thumb|250px|Lucas is treated in the infirmary]][[Reva Connors]] visits Lucas and reveals to him that [[Squabbles]] is dead, and that he could end up the same way. She begs to Burstein to put Lucas under the experiment to save him; Burstein refuses, stating that he would probably die from the experience, but Connors demands that he do it for her. He reluctantly agrees, asking Connors to take a trip home. He then goes up to Lucas, informing him that this is going to be a different treatment.<ref name="LC104 Flashbacks"/><ref name="LC104"/>
*'''[[Chase of Lorelei]]''': [[Lorelei]] arrives in [[Death Valley]], stopping at a roadside in where she enthralls newlywed [[Jimmy Mackenzie]].<ref name="AoS114">''[[T.A.H.I.T.I.|Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 1.14: T.A.H.I.T.I.]]''</ref> Mackenzie drives Lorelei to [[Rosie's Desert Oasis]] in [[Nevada]]. There, Lorelei abandons and kills Mackenzie in favor of a local biker gang, the [[Dogs of Hell]].<ref name="AoS115">''[[Yes Men|Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 1.15: Yes Men]]''</ref><ref name="AoS1 The Chase to Yes Men Placement">''[[Seeds]]'' has to occur in 2013 ("24 years" following 1989, see other references), and is placed finishing on December 17, 2013. ''[[Yes Men]]'' has to occur in 2014 ("last year" in 2015, see other references). ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: The Chase]]'' picks up reasonably shortly following the events of ''[[Seeds]]'', and leads into the events of ''[[T.R.A.C.K.S.]]''. ''[[T.A.H.I.T.I.]]'' follows immediately after, and ''[[Yes Men]]'' only a few days later (Skye is still recovering, Simmons has spent a few days taking her blood). As well as this, ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' has to occur as early as possible in January 2014 ("winter" following the film's events, "a few years" and "2 years" in ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'', see other references). From all of this, ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: The Chase'', ''T.R.A.C.K.S.'', and ''T.A.H.I.T.I.'' occur at the end of December 2013 (27th-30th), with ''Yes Men'' picking up with Simmons and Skye a few days later on January 3, 2014. This also fits with them having dealt with the Overkill Device "a while back," nearly 2 months from early November to late December.</ref><ref name="AoS2 Sif Last Year">In ''[[Who You Really Are]]'', Coulson refers to his last encounter with [[Sif]] as being "last year." The events of ''Who You Really Are'' have to occur in March 2015 (see other references to the timespan of ''[[A Fractured House]]'' to ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''), therefore placing ''[[Yes Men]]'' (the last encounter with Sif) in 2014.</ref>

*'''[[Escape from Seagate Prison]]''':
**[[File:Tiara Luke.png|thumb|250px|Lucas obtains his new powers]]As he begins scanning Lucas, [[Albert Rackham]] rushes in, demanding the whereabouts of Lucas. Burstein tries to stop him, but Rackham points a gun at him and threatens to kill Lucas for ratting him out. He turns up the heat in the tan and overloads it, causing the lights in the room to burst into sparks. Submersed in the boiling liquid, Lucas screams in pain as his injuries turn purple and then vanish. Rackham attempts to murder Lucas, but the tank explodes, killing him instead. Lucas comes out of the ruins of the tank, fully healed. The alarms goes off and in frustration for having no way out, Lucas hits the wall, causing it to crack severely, without any harm to himself.<ref name="LC104 Flashbacks"/><ref name="LC104"/>
**He discovers his strength has been enhanced, and proceeds to punch a hole in the wall in order to escape from [[Seagate Prison]]. Lucas finally reaches land, ending up in someone's back yard, where he notices the owner's laundry drying.<ref name="LC104 Flashbacks"/><ref name="LC104"/>
**[[File:OriginalCageCostume copy.jpg|thumb|250px|Lucas finally escapes from Seagate Prison]]Cage takes the shirt and pants, then goes to the nearest phone booth and calls Connors.<ref name="LC104 Flashbacks"/><ref name="LC104"/>
*Lucas meets with [[Reva Connors]] at the nearest motel. After spending some hours together, Connors deletes any records of Lucas and asks him to create a new name for himself; he chooses "Luke Cage". Cage and Connors share a kiss.<ref name="LC104 Flashbacks"/><ref name="LC104"/>

The date of him saying this is definitively June 2016 (the same day that the news says Lagos was "last month," with that date given by WHiH, see other references).

Obeying orders under the assumption that it is necessary to protect the [[United States of America]], [[Frank Castle]] shoots Zubair through the head. Unbeknown to the rest of the squad, [[Gunner Henderson]], starting to suspect that the Cerberus leaders have ulterior motives, secretly films the assassination.<ref name="TP1 Kandahar Flashbacks">In ''[[Kandahar (episode)|Kandahar]]'', it is shown that on Frank Castle's birthday, November 15th (see [[1970s#1976|1976]] references), there are "29 days" supposed to be remaining of their deployment. Therefore, they are due to finish on December 14th. In ''[[Home]]'', when Madani questions Castle about Kandahar, she asks, "You served many years as a Marine Force Recon?" He replies, "I did." She asks, "But that isn't where you served your last mission?", and Castle affirms, "No. I was part of a covert CIA operation. It was called Cerberus." Therefore, Kandahar was Castle's final deployment. However, in ''[[Kinbaku]]'', Ellison's statements firmly place the Massacre at Central Park on April 4, 2015 (see [[2015]] references), and in ''[[Penny and Dime]]'', Castle explains that this was the day after he got back from his final deployment. It must therefore be assumed that after Castle attacked William Rawlins on November 16th, similarly to how Russo "requested a transfer back to Force", Castle either requested to move or was forced to for his damaging attack on a superior officer, and had to serve an extra few months before finishing on April 3, 2015. This therefore makes the November that the Kandahar events take place November 2014.<br>In ''[[Crosshairs]]'', Frank Castle says "we did 15-month rotations in Afghanistan". Since they were due to finish on December 14, 2014, it can therefore be assumed that the deployment began around September 14, 2013. This also aligns with the fact that Castle says on November 15, 2014, "We have been doing it for a year," as it would have been 14 months.<br>Finally, the assassination of Ahmad Zubair takes place somewhere between the September 14, 2013 start of the operation and the November 15, 2014 abrupt ending, so it can be approximated as roughly halfway between, around the night of April 15-16, 2014.</ref><ref name="TP103">''[[Kandahar (episode)|The Punisher: 1.03: Kandahar]]''</ref>

[[File:Phil-Coulson-Sam-Koenig-Theta-Protocal.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Phil Coulson]] supervising [[Theta Protocol]] along [[Sam Koenig]]]]
*[[Phil Coulson]] tells [[Melinda May]] that he is on a recruiting trip to London, but instead secretly meets with [[Sam Koenig]] in the [[United States of America|United States]] to discuss [[Theta Protocol]], a project created after the [[HYDRA Uprising|collapse of S.H.I.E.L.D.]], to repair [[Helicarrier|Helicarrier No. 64]]. Koenig mentions that Simmons is settling in at HYDRA, and Coulson tells him the [[Skye]] is doing well in her training with May, [[Antoine Triplett]] is now fully on the team and [[Leo Fitz]] is making a little progress. They also discuss the new recruits [[Lance Hunter]], [[Isabelle Hartley]] and [[Idaho]]. He also asks for Koenig to keep looking for [[Robert Gonzales]], who they believe is highly likely to be dead.<ref name="AoS220">''[[Scars|Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 2.20: Scars]]''</ref><ref name="AoS201"/><ref name="AoS2 Shadows Placement">In ''[[Scars]]'', the onscreen text shows a scene set immediately preceding ''[[Shadows]]'' as being "one year ago." The events of ''Scars'' have to occur in May 2015 (see other references to the placement of ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''), with the reasoned date being May 7, 2015. A year prior to this places the scene in approximately late May 2014. Late May fits very nicely with Talbot's statement that Coulson and S.H.I.E.L.D. "managed to evade [Talbot and the military] for an entire winter." While this initially would suggest ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'' takes place in November 2013 and ''Shadows'' picks up in March 2014, this is not possible, with it having to occur in 2014 (various time references in ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'': Season 1 to spanning several months from September 2013 and a couple of months following ''Thor: The Dark World'', "2 years" in ''Captain America: Civil War'', see other references for more details). With the suggested timespan of ''Seeds'' to ''Yes Men'' putting ''Yes Men'' in early January 2014, it fits nicely with the end of ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'': Season 1 following ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'' immediately in mid-January. It can then be assumed that Talbot is referring to the remainder of winter (January-early March), and with it being now spring moving into summer, winter has come to a resolute, "entire" close. In ''Shadows'', Coulson states, "Our plane's been gathering dust for months." The last time the Bus was used was January 18, 2014, which fits as 4½ months later. He also states that "in the months since [Simmons left], [Fitz has] grown isolated." The reasoned date for Simmons leaving is January 30, 2014, which fits as 4 months later. Brett Dalton also is [http://tvline.com/2015/01/15/agents-of-shield-skye-ward-shooting-spoilers/ quoted as saying, "Ward had a hell of a time in the cage by himself for 6 months, he had some suicidal tendencies, and once he comes to the end of wrestling with all of his demons, he makes a promise; to reunite Skye with her dad."] The suicidal tendencies etc. refers to where we pick up in ''Shadows'', but the promise to Skye is ''[[Making Friends and Influencing People]]''. With that episode being mid-September (see other references to the stretch between ''[[Heavy is the Head]]'' and ''[[A Fractured House]]''), the middle of these two dates - late May and mid-September, is mid-to-late July, which works nicely as 6 months after mid-January. With Talbot going for a walk with his son around midday in ''Shadows'', it makes sense for this to be a Sunday, thereby finally dating it as May 29, 2014.</ref>

It then says, "Bouchard, who turned 20 in February." Eugenie Bouchard turned 20 in February 2014, suggesting this article is from between March 1, 2014 (for "February" to refer to February 2014) and December 31, 2014 (January/February 2015 would likely make it "last February"). Finally, the Eugenie Bouchard-Shelby Rogers tennis match is referenced, from August 6, 2014. Overall, it should be from between August 6, 2014 and December 31, 2014, suggesting approximately October 2014. October 15, 2014 would make the most sense, being the anniversary of the 1987 game news story included in the paper - reprinting it for a "this day in history"-type segment.</ref><ref name="Lot503"/>

[http://screenrant.com/guardians-of-the-galaxy-2-details/ Here] it is quoted as "a couple months" after, which implies about 2⅓ months. [http://www.slashfilm.com/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2-set-visit/ Here] it is quoted as "3 months." Collecting all of these, the average is around 2⅓ months later. The end scene of ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' is dated as August 8, 2014, so 2⅓ months later is October 18, 2014. As for when the film is "set" - this could either reference when it picks up at the beginning, or when the middle of the film is set. The beginning of the film is the afternoon of the film's 1st day, and the middle of the film is the morning of the film's 3rd day, so the best day to assign the October 18, 2014 date to is the 2nd day, therefore meaning the film starts on October 17, 2014.</ref>
