    "desc": "In <i>[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]</i>, Ego says he has been building his planet, since he came into existence, for \"millions of years\".<br>\"Millions\" would technically refer to a minimum of 2 million years, and a maximum realistically of 9.99999. It can be up to 19.99999, which is just before it becomes \"tens of millions\", so a weighted average means the maximum is roughly 13.33333 million years. This would mean that \"millions\" strictly refers to approximately, to find the midpoint, (2 + 13.33333) ÷ 2 = 7.66667 million years.<br>However, it is rare for people to refer to \"tens of millions\" or \"hundreds of millions\", and this needs to be taken into account - that Ego may simply be referring to any number ending in \"millions\" (be it units, tens, or hundreds). The middle of these is tens of millions, which is absolute minimum 10 and realistic minimum 20, to realistic maximum 99.99999 and absolute maximum 199.99999. Therefore, with weighted averages, it is roughly minimum 16.66667 million years, maximum 133.33333 years, and the midpoint of these is (16.66667 + 133.33333) ÷ 2 = 75 million years.<br>Finally, averaging these two figures, you get around (7.66667 + 75) ÷ 2 = 41.33333 million years as an approximation for the term \"millions\".<br>Ego then later says \"millions and millions\". This is also a hard number to quantify, but can be boiled down to either meaning \"millions + millions\" (so × 2), or \"millions on top of millions\", like building to the power of 2 (so × 2², or × 4). From this, one could say that it is around × (2 + 4) ÷ 2 = × 3. Therefore, one could approximate that \"millions and millions\" means roughly 41.33333 × 3 = 124 million years.<br>The average of <i>these two</i> is then (41.33333 + 124) ÷ 2 = 82.66667 million years, meaning overall that Ego was born <i>very</i> approximately 82,666,666.66667 years before 2014. This gives roughly 82,664,653 B.C. - or c. 80,000,000 B.C. to 1 significant figure (to signify that it is a <i>very</i> rough approximation).<br>The Celestial scenes shown by the Collector in <i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i> can be assumed to have occurred around the same era."

The average of these two dates is December 15, 1980, putting the date of the 1980 scene as May 19th, and the 1988 scene as December 29th. Peter's clothing at his kidnapping indicates the 1988 scene should not be any earlier than early-to-mid-November. So with that at the latest date of November 10, 1988, this would put Peter's birthday around October 27, 1980, and the 1980 scene at March 31, 1980. This is all somewhat corroborated by James Gunn in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JamesGunn/status/863882306431328257\">a Twitter post</a>."

With that dated to May 12, 1994 (see [[1990s]] references), he would have been born between May 13, 1984 and May 12, 1985. Him starting college is dated to Fall 2003 (see [[2000s]] references), which would imply he was around 18 at the time, suggesting he was born between September 1, 1984 and August 31, 1985, so overall likely between September 1, 1984 and May 12, 1985. It is implied in <i>Stick</i> that Murdock is no longer 9 by his first meeting with Stick, as he refers to being blinded when he was 9. With that scene dated to January 12, 1995 (see [[1990s]] references), this would mean he was 10 by then, so born no later than January 12, 1985, and thus likely between September 1, 1984 and January 12, 1985.<br>In <i>[[Revelations]]</i>, Maggie Grace is said in flashbacks to be 3 weeks from taking her vows as a nun when she meets Jack Murdock, and in present day explains when she conceived Matt, she had not yet taken her vows. So, Grace becoming a nun must have been shortly after Matt's conception, about 9 months before his birth. This would mean she became a nun approximately between December 1983 and April 1984. She states in September 2017 (see [[2017]] references), in <i>[[Resurrection]]</i>, that she has been a nun for \"30 years\". So, while she must be rounding down whatever the case, April 1984 works best, and therefore an approximate early January 1985 date of birth for Matt Murdock.<br>Assuming Murdock's 30th birthday must occur in January 2015 before the events of <i>[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]</i>: [[Daredevil (TV series)/Season One|Season 1]], the latest Murdock could have been born is January 8, 1985. Assuming his date of birth is around then, 267 days earlier (an average pregnancy from conception to birth) would put Jack Murdock and Maggie Grace sleeping together as around April 16, 1984. Assuming that this was later in the 3-week span between them meeting and Grace becoming a nun, rather than earlier, it can be estimated to around 2 days before her vows (not the day before, as she would likely mention that detail when saying it was before her vows, were that the case). So, Grace becoming a nun can be approximated to April 18, 1984, and her meeting Jack Murdock therefore March 28, 1984.<br>With Murdock appearing to be roughly 3-4 months old in the scene showing Grace's post-partum depression, this is estimated to 3.5 months after his approximate date of birth, so April 23, 1985."

Assuming Johnson's birthday was kept the same, just the year changed, then with her real date of birth approximated to August 1985 (see other references), specifically August 20th, then her fake date of birth can be assumed as the first available August 20th after December 1987: August 20, 1988. If Jackson was killed about 242 days prior (the approximate amount of time between a woman finding out she is pregnant and giving birth), for Mariah's lie to be believable, then he would have died around December 21, 1987.

Judging from Rambeau being credited as 11 in June 1995 and actress Akira Akbar being 11.6 at the time of filming, Rambeau's date of birth would be approximated to December 1983 (see final approximated date of birth, September 1983, references for further explanation).<br>Azari Akbar is credited as \"Monica Rambeau (5 Years Old)\", making Rambeau approximately 5.5. Azari Akbar herself was 6.7 years old during filming, suggesting Rambeau is slightly closer to 5.99 than 5.0. Working forwards from December 1989, her appearances would then be around mid-1989. They cannot be later than June 21, 1989, with Danvers disappearing on June 22, 1989 (see other references) and the appearances set before then.<br>So, the closest Halloween and Christmas to the ideal mid-1989 placement for Azari Akbar's appearances, while still being pre-June 22, 1989, are Halloween 1988 and Christmas 1988.

    "desc": "In <i>[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]</i>, as the Skrulls cycle through Carol Danvers' memories, they first see the memory of Danvers with Maria Rambeau about to perform a test flight. They then go back to Danvers as a child, but have gone too far back, so go forward and see her doing rope training, presumably some time before the test flight because it is at the training stage, but also because they are trying to narrow down to the right memory. This memory then continues into one with Danvers being belittled in Pancho's Bar and, seemingly the same day (Danvers is in the same T-shirt), her playing pool with Rambeau. This continues into another memory of Pancho's Bar, karaoke. Following this, there is a memory of Danvers as a child watching the stars, then her with the Rambeaus watching the stars. There is no reason the Skrulls would have gone further back than the go karting to see an ever younger Danvers, knowing this to be too far back, so her as a child can be taken as a memory within Danvers' memory of watching the stars with Monica Rambeau, something she recalled as she did it, in which case the stars follows on from the karaoke and is still before the test flight with Maria Rambeau. Norex then finds the moment of Danvers with \"Lawson\". Since they are narrowing down where the memory is, it should presumably still be between the stars and the test flight.<br>So, the chronology is the rope scene, then the man and pool at Pancho's, then karaoke at Pancho's, then watching the stars, then Lawson, then the test flight. And we know that, after all of this, was Danvers' crash with Lawson/Mar-Vell and her being abducted by Starforce.<br>The abduction is said through the film, mostly on June 12, 1995 (see other references), and through external sources, to be both \"6 years ago\" and in \"1989\". So, it can be taken to be somewhere between exactly 6 years prior - June 12, 1989 - and the approximation for \"1989\" of the exact middle of 1989 - July 2, 1989 - making the crash and abduction roughly June 22, 1989.<br>With the watching the stars dated to April 25, 1989 (see other references) and the abduction dated to June 22, 1989, Lawson and the test flight can be approximated as ⅓ and ⅔ between the two, so May 14, 1989 and June 3, 1989 respectively.<br>So, with Danvers flying the planes by May 14, 1989, the rope training scene can be approximated to be 6 months or so prior - roughly November 14, 1988. This then means that the man and pool at Pancho's and karaoke at Pancho's can be approximated as ⅓ and ⅔ between November 14, 1988 and April 25, 1989, so January 7, 1989 and March 2, 1989 respectively."

However, Jack Murdock died a couple of months before Stick met Matt, which was another several months before he left Matt. If there is around 8 months between Jack's death and Stick leaving Matt, working from the midpoint between these two suggestions, mid-1995, 4 months either way would suggest that Jack died around early 1995 and Stick left Matt around late 1995. However, the subtitles of <i>[[Cut Man]]</i> <a href=\"https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Thread:241334#106\">show Creel vs. Murdock to be November 12th</a>, so it can be shifted to the nearest November: November 12, 1994. This lines up with the fact that the poster in the episode shows it to be a Saturday, with November 12, 1994 being a Saturday.

The implication is that this was when Fury was promoted to Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.. As well as this, in the photograph he is holding from then, Fury looks not much younger than he does in the present, 2014 events, suggesting perhaps a 2000s setting, and Fury says in <i>[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]</i>, in June 1995 (see other references), that he has had a desk job for \"the past 6 years\", implying that this operation should not be between mid-1989 and June 1995. However, Fury loses his eye in <i>Captain Marvel</i>, in June 1995, and has two eyes in Pierce's photograph. He cannot be trying a glass eye in the photograph, as he is shown in <i>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</i> to still have the scarred eye in the socket, so the photograph must be before June 1995, before <i>Captain Marvel</i>. Considering he looks older than he does in that film, it should be as late as possible. Fury is bald in the photograph, but has short hair in <i>Captain Marvel</i>, so the photograph needs to be at least a month before <i>Captain Marvel</i> for him to grow the hair. Placing the photograph as late as possible, a month before his appearance in <i>Captain Marvel</i>, it can be approximated to May 12, 1995. The Bogotá operation is presumably about a week earlier, so can be approximated to May 5, 1995. It can be assumed that Fury being Deputy Chief of the station in Bogotá was just one of his desk jobs from 1989 to 1995, and ordering the operation did not involve entering the field himself, or did but was a one-off so not enough to break what he considered 6 years of a desk job."

On top of this, Jon Watts said, <a href=\"http://www.pressreader.com/australia/empire-australasia/20170701/281513636097609\">\"the eight-year-old Peter had seen Stark say, 'I am Iron Man,' on TV.\"</a> \"I am Iron Man\" is dated to November 25, 2009 (see other references), putting Parker's birthday at the earliest on November 26, 2009. This would put his birthday in the range of November 26, 2000-September 7, 2001. Finally, <a href=\"http://newyorkschooltalk.org/2016/10/nyc-give-parents-flexibility-kindergarten-start-dates/\">in New York, students start kindergarten (the year before 1st grade) in September of the calendar year in which they turn 5</a>. With Parker being a sophomore (10th grade) in September 2016, this means he turns 15 in the calendar year of 2016 - meaning he was born in 2001. So, he was born between January 1, 2001 and September 7, 2001.<br>In <i>[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]</i>, it is shown on Parker's passport that he was born on \"10 AUG\", making his date of birth August 10, 2001.<br>Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have stated that in <i>[[Captain America: Civil War]]</i>, <a href=\"http://time.com/4312912/captain-america-civil-war-stephen-mcfeely-christopher-markus/\">Parker is 15 years old.</a> While this would work if his date of birth was before June 23, 2001 (his first appearance in <i>Captain America: Civil War</i> is on June 23, 2016), it does not fit with the \"10 AUG\" date of birth (chosen by Marvel as a reference to the August 10, 1962 <i>Amazing Fantasy #15</i> release date), and the date from the film has to overrule the writers' comment, making him 14 in <i>Captain America: Civil War</i>."

In <i>[[The Mistress of All Agonies]]</i>, Ward Meachum's birthday is given as September 19, 1986 (see other references), and in <i>[[Snow Gives Way]]</i>, Ward says, \"I was 15 when [the Rands] died.\" This definitively places the air crash between September 19, 2001 and September 18, 2002. On top of this, the iPod 1st Generation, which Rand owns at the time of the crash, was released on October 23, 2001, and in the  video, it is said that Harold's death, which is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarvelIronFist/status/842121466749452288\">known to be 2004</a>, albeit reasoned as early January, was \"2 years\" after the crash. From all of this, the accident is reasoned as October 29, 2001, six days after the iPod's release, a little over 2 years before January 4, 2004, and still reasonable enough to be considered \"15 years\" before February 2016, by the simple math of \"2016 - 2001 = 15\". This also allows time for Danny's arm to have healed since the break in July.<br>While <a href=\"http://www.zacharyzirlin.com/iron-fist/hl14k2gwamr2adw3bpekpmvm6cejfn\">prop-makers designed a September 2002 date for the crash</a>, this does not match the other evidence, and when the props appear in  <i>[[Rolling Thunder Cannon Punch]]</i>, the Rands' graves are intentionally obscured to not show the year of death, but only \"200-\", leaving the date ambiguous, and allowing for October 2001, which fits much better."

They are takes on <i>Conan the Barbarian</i>, <i>The Toxic Avenger Part II</i>, a late 2000s romantic comedy, <i>Horns</i>, <i>Inception</i>, and <i>Steve Jobs</i> respectively. With the fact that Williams seems to be roughly the same age in all the pictures (as they were all taken together), that he could not have looked to be in his 40s in 1982 (when <i>Conan the Barbarian</i> was released) and also films released in present day, that <i>Steve Jobs</i> was released in 2015, after the film's 2014 setting, and <i>Horns</i> was released 4 years after <i>Inception</i>, when the <i>Dead Before Arrival</i> posters says it is \"from the director of <i>Haxan 2</i>\", these films cannot simply replace their respective films in the <i>Marvel Cinematic Universe</i>. <i>Oh, Rebecca</i> resembles a lot of romantic comedy films that were released around 2008, so it would make sense for it to have been released around Valentine's Day, February 14, 2008. <i>Dead Before Arrival</i> can still fit on the release date for <i>Inception</i>, July 16, 2010. The fact that it is \"from the director of <i>Haxan 2</i>\" means it is worth looking at the career of the director of Inception, Christopher Nolan, whose previous film was <i>The Dark Knight</i>, released in 2008, which would imply that <i>Haxan 2</i> was released around 2008. It says it was released on \"October 31\", so October 31, 2008. The rights to make <i>Steve Jobs</i> were acquired 3 days after his death, and then it took 1476 days before it was released. Assuming the rights to make <i>Tony Stark</i> were acquired 3 days after \"I am Iron Man\", so November 28, 2009, the film would have come out around December 13, 2013. The remaining two films can presumably have been released in the order of the films they reference, so <i>Arkon</i>, then <i>Toxic Janitor 2</i>. Based on approximately how old Fillion was when he took the photos (using April 14, 2016, the middle of filming for <i>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2</i>, then working back from the approximate dates when Simon Williams would have filmed the movies (about November 6, 2006 for <i>Haxan 2</i> (based on the time between the middle of filming and release for <i>Horns</i>), July 17, 2007 for <i>Oh, Rebecca</i> (based on the time between the middle of filming and release for 2008's <i>Sex and the City</i>)), September 7, 2009 for <i>Dead Before Arrival</i> (based on the filming schedule for <i>Inception</i>), and April 19, 2013 for <i>Tony Stark</i> (based on the time between the middle of filming and release for <i>Steve Jobs</i>) and taking an average, Simon Williams would have been born approximately in April 1964. Nathan Fillion was about 32 years and 9 months old when the first film that he was the main actor in, <i>Water's Edge</i>, was released on January 27, 2004. If Simon Williams were roughly the same age at the time of the first film in which he was the main actor, this first film would have come out around February 16, 1997. Therefore, his career as being the headline actor would have spanned from then to October 19, 2014 (when the film festival scene would have been set in <i>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2</i>), and so distributing the two films at a third and two thirds of the way between these dates would put <i>Arkon</i> around January 8 (rounded to 10th, the nearest Friday), 2003, and <i>Toxic Janitor 2</i> around November 28, 2008."

Assuming they have been married for around 5 months, they would have got married around December 15, 2007.

It is said that this is the \"weekend\" and her time could have been spent as time with Garner soon after that first date - the second Saturday following October 23, 2003 was November 1st. This also fits with Coulson's security level progression over time. Coulson progressed to Level 7 around the time of <i>Marvel One-Shot: The Consultant</i>, which is dated to July 2010, and he implies in <i>All the Madame's Men</i> that he was recruited into S.H.I.E.L.D. academy straight after he left high school, which <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKxoWoRH26Y\">Clark Gregg confirmed</a>, around July 1982. He therefore would have progressed to become a Level 1 agent a few years later. In the following couple of decades at S.H.I.E.L.D., he progressed 6 levels. This would mean he progressed to Level 4 around the late 1990s, before progressing to Level 5 around the early 2000s, and so him being Level 4 in the flashbacks in 2003 fits, assuming he did not progress at exact regular intervals. It would likely be very soon before he reached Level 5."

However, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarvelIronFist/status/842121466749452288\">an official video revealed Harold died in 2004.</a> To make this fit as best as possible, Harold's death is dated to the first few days of 2004 - January 4th specifically - to be as close as possible to fitting best. This fits with Ward's statement that it was \"12 years ago\", and it can be assumed that all the news coverage for his illness was in the final months of 2003, and so others might remember it as being an event mainly in 2003, or just counting inclusively, for whatever reason referring to it as \"13 years ago\".<br>This fits with <i>[[The Dragon Dies at Dawn]]</i>, when Joy says, \"I believe it for the first 6 months.

The film seems to suggest it is c. 2004 with the CCTV image from April 2004, and simultaneously suggests it is 2006 from the newspaper of the incident showing \"-06\". This April 2005 date fits nicely in the middle of these, as well as being a rounded \"5 years\" before November 25, 2009, \"I am Iron Man\", as shown on Marvel's timeline, and \"5 years\" before May-June 2010, the events of <i>The Incredible Hulk</i>, as stated in the film and a deleted scene. The 2004 image is of Banner, not the Hulk, and so could be surveillance of him as he works on the project, and the 06 does not show the full \"2006\" and could be interpreted as an issue number, price, or something other. The 2005 date fits nicely and should be used. The comic shows that Bruce running away was \"3 days\" later, putting it on April 19, 2005, then shows that his next incident was on the Canadian border, on \"05/19/05\", May 19, 2005. It goes on to detail how this was followed by \"months of nothing\" where the \"trail went cold,\" until the incident in \"the heart of South America\". Approximately 5 months would put this around October 18, 2005.<br>There is then a gap from October 18, 2005-May 27, 2006 before the next location, which we know from the film included Bruce attempting contact on \"02/07/06\", February 7, 2006.<br>The film shows that on \"05/27/06\" and \"05/28/06\", May 27-28, 2006, Bruce was sighted in Canada.<br>There is then another gap from May 28, 2006-September 4, 2006.<br>The film shows that on \"09/04/06\" (also accompanied by \"2006\"), September 4, 2006, there is an incident at a house, which seems to be placed on the map around Asia, roughly the Kyrgyzstan area, it does not actually show its exact position.<br>There is another gap from September 4, 2006-January 22, 2007, in which on October 21, 2006 (shown on a letter) there was an unknown incident where Hulk fled the scene, the last sighting for at least 5 months.<br>The film shows that on \"01/22/07\" (also accompanied by \"2007\"), so January 22, 2007, there was an incident ending in a crumpled car in Samara, Russia, which must not have actually been a sighting, just evidence left behind.<br>There is then the final gap from January 22, 2007-April 12, 2010, in which a letter was written in March 2007 saying there had been no sightings for \"5 months\" since \"October 21, 2006\". The last time Bruce turned into the Hulk was on November 5, 2009, because the day after the ambush in Rio, which is on May 14, 2010, it can briefly be seen that before his counter reset that he had gone \"190 days without incident\".<br>The film then begins on April 12, 2010, \"158 days without incident,\" in Rocinha.<br>There is a sighting in Dakota, which would make sense to fit when Bruce is travelling up from South America to Canada, in the October 18, 2005-May 27, 2006 gap. Based on the distances, Hulk being in Dakota in between these dates would fall around May 14, 2006.<br>There is a sighting which is reported as a \"Green sasquatch\". Sites seem to believe this is the Canada sighting on May 28, 2006. There is a raid, which seems to follow on from the sighting in Canada image, so can also be assigned to Canada.<br>In a deleted scene, corroborated by a piece of dialogue from <i>The Avengers</i>, it is shown that Banner attempted suicide in the Arctic. This fits in the May 28, 2006-September 4, 2006 gap, just before the travel to Southeast Asia. There is a line on a map suggesting Banner travelled from Northwest Canada/the Arctic to Southeast Asia. This fits in the May 28, 2006-September 4, 2006 gap, following the incident in Canada. There are two dots suggesting Bruce was in Japan, which also fits in that gap, following the travel to Southeast Asia. The distances between each approximate location from Canada, to Nunavut, to Southeast Asia, to Sapporo, and then to roughly Kyrgyzstan between these dates would put Nunavut around June 7, 2006, Southeast Asia around August 2, 2006, and Sapporo around August 6, 2006.<br>There is a \"2006\" incident with a truck, which can be assigned to the October 21, 2006 date, especially since it appears to be nearer to Europe from the company name helping the truck, which fits as Bruce is heading in the direction of Europe at that point. There is a \"March 07\" flight, which some sites have dated as March 2, 2007. This is presumably Bruce crossing the Atlantic to the U.S.A. Banner was in \"the States\" and encountered Nick Fury in <i>The Incredible Hulk: The Fury Files</i>. It would make sense for this to be following the beginning of the Avenger Initiative in 2008, as given in <i>Melinda</i>. In the film, there is a letter written by Fury from S.H.I.E.L.D., which can be assigned to just after this. A part where a military search highlighted on a map for which the latitude and longitude seems to suggest around Libya, fitting in this gap, before his final travel from Africa to South America. This travel is shown when military helicopters seem to be flying southwest from an African location (by latitude and longitude) toward South America, which we know was Bruce's final destination. It can be assumed that his last incident on November 5, 2009 was in South America, and is what led the military to follow across the Atlantic. The distances between each approximate location from Samara, to the U.S.A., to Libya, and then to east South America between these dates would put the U.S.A. around February 27, 2008 (although it seems to be a Saturday, because he is watching soccer, so March 1, 2008), which fits with the Avenger Initiative just starting up, and Libya around March 2, 2009."

    "desc": "In <i>[[AKA I Want Your Cray Cray]]</i>, it is said when Alisa Jones wakes that she has been at the facility for \"5 years\". She arrived on April 13, 2000 (see other references), making this approximately April 2005. Additionally, it is implied when she is next seen on June 27, 2005 (see other references) that she has been awake for no more than a month or so, only now following up on the conversation she had about Jessica when she woke and only now trying on a wig for the first time. Overall, this would make Alisa's waking approximately April/May 2005.<br>However, Jessica Jones is shown meeting Stirling Adams after, and then by June 27, 2005 she has started a relationship with him, dropped out of college, and they have moved in together, with Jones talking about how Adams has stuck around for her. This would usually take 6 months at a conservative estimate, suggesting Jones meeting Adams is around December 2004. However, on June 28, 2005, Jones has not seen Walker in \"a month\" and when she sees her again, it is news to her that Jones has a boyfriend, implying that them getting together happened in the last month, i.e. the last time they saw each other was in fact the scene shown, the evening she and Adams met - which would make that May 2005. However, it is possible that Jones simply did not tell Walker about Adams the last time they met. Still, Jones also describes the relationship as \"recent\", implying only a couple of months, starting no later than around April 2005. Overall, the evidence suggests this is around March 2005.<br>The evidence would place Alisa Jones waking as close as possible to April/May 2005, but Jessica Jones meeting Adams as close as possible to March 2005, so since Jessica meeting Adams occurs after, they can be taken to be the same day, as close as possible to each other to get as close as possible to their respective ideal placements. Therefore, the evidence can be taken as a whole.<br>April 13, 2000 being 5 years ago suggests approximately April 13, 2005. It only seemingly being maximum of about a month since Alisa Jones woke up on June 27, 2005 suggests not too much earlier than May 27, 2005. The progression of Jones and Adams' relationship suggests not too much later than December 27, 2004. Trish Walker not knowing suggests they met \"a month\" before June 28, 2005, so roughly May 28, 2005 if you take exactly, or just May 2005 if considering \"June 2005 - 1 month = May 2005\", the middle of which is May 16, 2005, overall approximately May 24, 2005 (putting more weight in the specifics). Finally, it being \"recent\" suggests not too much earlier than April 28, 2005.<br>The average of these five dates places the scenes on approximately April 12, 2005."

It is stated in <i>[[AKA Ain't We Got Fun]]</i> in May 2017 that these events were \"12 years ago\", and it is also shown in <i>AKA I Want Your Cray Cray</i> that these events are months after events said to be \"5 years\" since April 2000 - both of these place these events in specifically the summer of 2005. The hottest time in New York is <a href=\"https://www.holiday-weather.com/new_york_city/averages/\">July and August</a>, and when Jones and Walker sit on the rooftop together the day after Jones helps the children, there is a movie showing as in <i>[[AKA Start at the Beginning]]</i>, when it is said that a movie plays on that roof on the \"first Friday every month\". Therefore, it should either be Friday, July 1, 2005 or Friday, August 5, 2005. July 1, 2005 makes the most sense, since 3 days prior Walker is asking Jones when they see each other for the first time in \"a month\" how her studies are going, and Jones informs her she has dropped out. Jones would not have been studying in the month from early July to early August if this were August 2, 2005 since it would be summer break from college - if it is June 28, 2005, however, it makes sense for Walker to ask about college, since there has been college term time since they last saw each other in May.<br>Alisa Jones finding Dorothy Walker and seeing Jessica does not appear to be the morning immediately following Alisa's escape and Jessica beating Wyatt, as Alisa needs time to find Dorothy Walker and Wyatt needs a short time to recover, so it can be taken that Alisa finding Walker is in fact the day after. So, Alisa Jones finding out about Jessica and subsequently escaping, while Jessica and Stirling Adams get closer and go to see Walker, then Alisa killing Adams and Walker talking to her the next day, all occurs from June 27, 2005 to July 1, 2005."

In the same episode, Tyrone mentions that he has known Father Delgado for 3 years, which would suggests he is in February of junior year, meaning he was born 16.4-17.4 years ago, so since it is an August and date of birth and currently February, he would be 16.5. 16.5 years after August 2000 gives February 2017.*In <i>Call/Response</i>, a magazine says, \"Currently chairs a committee in 2017.\"*Stan Bartlett's license plate as mentioned says \"18\", which means it is between 2016 and 2018.*In <i>[[Colony Collapse]]</i>, on Mardi Gras, Scarborough references the surname Rand being a name that means you are known to be rich currently, implying Season 1, Episode 10: The Rands are referred to, suggesting Danny Rand is back in the world. Mardi Gras in 2016 was February 6th, before Danny Rand has returned, so it does not fit with 2016, but would make it February 2017 or 2018.*The basketball state finals occur days before Mardi Gras. The basketball state finals in Louisiana tend to be early March, and 2017 is the year where Mardi Gras is as close as possible to this, on February 28th.The total evidence for a February 2010 accident and February 2018 present events:*Nathan Bowen's work ID as mentioned.*The oil rig schematic revisions as mentioned.*In <i>First Light</i>, <i>Lush Life</i> by Leo Islo plays in-universe. This song was put online on March 27, 2017, so the only possible February is 2018.*In <i>First Light</i>, <i>Right Now</i> by Vindata plays in-universe. This song was put online on February 22, 2017. This is just 12 days too late to fit with February 2017, so the only possible February is 2018.*Tyrone has a \"FREE COMIC BOOK DAY 1st Saturday in May - May 6, 2017\" leaflet as mentioned, which could work with 2018 if you assume he just left it up for several months after.*In <i>Suicide Sprints</i>, Adina Johnson has the book <i>Grief Cottage</i>, which was released August 2017, so the only possible February is 2018.*As mentioned, there is an (unreliable) August 2000 date of birth given for Tyrone in <i>Suicide Sprints</i>. In <i>Rabbit Hold</i>, it is shown on a poster and stated that Tyrone is \"18\". The October where he would be 18 would be October 2018, making Season 1 February 2018.*In <i>Princeton Offense</i>, O'Reilly looks at narcotics arrest files that she describes as being from \"about 8 years ago\", and the files on screen are from \"02/18/2010\", suggesting this is February 2018.*In <i>Princeton Offense</i>, news stories from \"hours ago\" are real life news stories from September 2017. This does not work for any February, though if it has to suggest one it would be February 2018, because at least those stories have happened by then.*Stan Bartlett's license plate as mentioned says \"18\", which works so long as the plate was registered between February and December 2016.*In <i>Ghost Stories</i>, Tyrone's phone says \"Thursday, October 5\". October 5th was a Thursday in 2017, and was the day of filming. This does not work for any February, though if it has to suggest one it would be February 2018, because it is more likely if the phone has the wrong date that it would be a past date, not a future one, if the phone was accidentally reset or something similar.*Scarborough's reference to the Rands as mentioned.*In <i>[[Alignment Chart]]</i>, an obituary for Kenneth Fuchs says, \"Fuchs, aged 32, passed away on February 11, 2018.\"Overall, when weighing up the value of each piece of evidence and the specificity and making compromises, February 2009/2017 comes out as the strongest option."

However, the evidence for which years they are set in is contradictory.<br>A 2008 setting for <i>Iron Man</i> is implied by:*A date on a TV in <i>Iron Man</i> which says \"May 4, 2008\".*Vision's line from <i>[[Captain America: Civil War]]</i>, firmly on June 19, 2016, saying, \"In the 8 years since Mr. Stark announced himself as Iron Man.\"*A statement from Kevin Feige (<a href=\"https://moviepilot.com/p/kevin-feige-peter-parker-mcu-origin-spider-man-homecoming/4234700\">1</a>, <a href=\"http://www.aintitcool.com/node/77511\">2</a>) implying 4 years between <i>Iron Man</i> and <i>The Avengers</i>, which is firmly set in May 2012.However, a 2009 setting for <i>Iron Man</i> is implied by:* showing that \"I am Iron Man\" is 67 years after March 1942 (date shown on-screen in <i>[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]</i>), when Schmidt took the Tesseract, 67 years after June 22, 1943 (date given by newspaper in <i>Captain America: The First Avenger</i> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BG-WGtcr3Ub\">confirmed by Marvel</a>), when Steve went through Project Rebirth, 64 years after early February 1945 (date given by <a href=\"http://www.icollector.com/Leaked-telegram-from-Col-Phillips_i12119993\">auctioned prop from <i>Captain America: The First Avenger</i></a> and supported by newspaper in <i>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</i> from a while after the disappearance, as well as Reinhardt's arrest date a while after Red Skull's death, shown in <i>The Things We Bury</i> - all explained in [[1940s]] references), when Steve went into the ice, meaning the timeline overall presents late 2009 for \"I am Iron Man\".*Jon Watts saying that <a href=\"http://www.pressreader.com/australia/empire-australasia/20170701/281513636097609\">\"the eight-year-old Peter had seen Stark say, 'I am Iron Man,' on TV,\"</a> and <a href=\"https://www.comicbookmovie.com/spider-man/homecoming/spider-man-homecoming-director-jon-watts-says-iron-man-was-always-part-of-the-film-a152207\">again that Peter was 8 at that moment</a>, with the fact that Peter was born in early 2001 (from <a href=\"http://time.com/4312912/captain-america-civil-war-stephen-mcfeely-christopher-markus/\">him being 15 in <i>Captain America: Civil War</i></a>, June 2016, and \"15\" in <i>Spider-Man: Homecoming</i>, September 2016, as well as <a href=\"http://newyorkschooltalk.org/2016/10/nyc-give-parents-flexibility-kindergarten-start-dates/\">a New York sophomore in 2016-17, meaning he was born in 2001</a>).*<i>[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.|Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]</i>: [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D./Season Two|Season 2]], Episode 17 - <i>[[Melinda]]</i>, set firmly in April 2015 in the lead-up to <i>[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]</i> (see [[2015]] references), flashing back to \"7 years ago\" when the Avengers Initiative was just starting up, seemingly a while before <i>Iron Man</i>.A pre-2010 (2008 or 2009) setting is implied by:*In <i>[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]</i>, when Ultron scrolls through images, a \"FEB/12/2010\" photo is shown of the Mark I armour. The photo could have been taken any time after the Mark I was made, but since the Mark I was only completed in May, this means it cannot be later than May 2009.*In <i>Avengers: Age of Ultron</i>, when Ultron scrolls through images, an old \"news archive\" story about Iron Man is shown from \"20.07.10\", including footage of him in Gulmira. This means that the Battle of Gulmira, in November of its year, can be no later than November 2009, for a news report from July 2010 to feature footage from it.The second half of <i>Iron Man 2</i>, the events of <i>Thor</i>, and the second half of <i>The Incredible Hulk</i> are all set in the same week, known as \"Fury's Big Week\", as detailed in the <i>[[The Avengers Prelude: Fury's Big Week]]</i> comic, on Marvel's timeline, and shown in the films. <i>Iron Man 2</i> also cannot span more than a few weeks, because:*The Expo is said to only be a year long, and there is \"362 days left\" on the day of Pepper's hiring and \"343 days left\" on the day of the Battle at Stark Expo.*Tony jokes that Pepper has only been CEO for \"a week\" after the Expo fight. Although the \"days left\" just mentioned shows it has been 19 days, still, it cannot be any longer.*The Monaco incident, which is after Pepper's hiring, is shown on Marvel's timeline to still be 6 months after \"I am Iron Man\", when the senate meeting <i>before</i> her hiring is also said by Hammer to be \"6 months\" after the end of <i>Iron Man</i> and the Expo opening before <i>that</i> is shown to be \"6 months later\" (confirmed by Jon Favreau in DVD commentary to refer to the time since \"I am Iron Man\"). So, the Monaco incident is definitely within a month of the Expo opening.*The inspired canon <i>[[The Avengers: Iron Man Mark VII]]</i> comic shows that the ice problem test flight in <i>Iron Man</i> is on or after \"Day 1\", that the fight in Monaco is between \"Day 189\" and \"Day 199\", and that the Battle at Stark Expo in Fury's Big Week is before \"Day 199\", meaning that the end of <i>Iron Man 2</i> is still just over 6 months maximum after.*The rate at which Tony's palladium poisoning is increasing means that the film cannot realistically span more than a few weeks anyway.A 2010 setting is implied for Fury's Big Week by:*The <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20100420085102/http://www.starkexpo2010.com/\"><i>Stark Expo 2010</i> website</a> saying that the Expo - the first Expo since 1974, the same one shown in the film - begins on \"May 7th 2010\".*A letter on the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20100420085102/http://www.starkexpo2010.com/\"><i>Stark Expo 2010</i> website</a> also saying that the Expo begins on \"May 7th . 2010\".*A computer in <i>Iron Man 2</i> saying \"05.06.10\".*The Grand Prix de Monaco Historique appearing in <i>Iron Man 2</i>, which is a biannual event which was held in May 2010.*Blonsky being known to have been born on \"March 1, 1971\", as said in a deleted scene, and saying in <i>The Incredible Hulk</i> that he is \"39\".*Fury saying Steve slept for \"almost 70 years\" in <i>Captain America: The First Avenger</i>, Steve saying he slept for \"70 years\" in <i>The Avengers</i>, and then more specific with \"65 years\" in <i>[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]</i> - overall implying he slept for about 66½-66¾ years. And, having gone into the ice in February 1945, this therefore implying he woke around late 2011, and <i>The Avengers Prelude: Fury's Big Week</i> shows that this is \"one year later\" after the end of Fury's Big Week.*Tony Stark's file, on display at an event and shown in a deleted scene from <i>The Avengers</i>, saying he was CEO of Stark Industries until 2010.*Natasha saying to Bruce on May 2, 2012, \"You've been more than a year without an incident. I don't think you wanna break that streak,\" when we know he had incidents in Harlem, then a month later in British Columbia (both in <i>The Incredible Hulk</i>), and those incidents were in June and July respectively, meaning they cannot be 2011.*The <i>[[Iron Man 3 Prelude]]</i> showing that 10 months before <i>The Avengers</i>, in July 2011, enough time had passed since <i>Iron Man 2</i> that all of the damage at the Expo had been cleaned up, Stark Tower had been fully planned, the foundations had been laid, and the first few levels had already been constructed.However, a 2011 setting for Fury's Big Week is implied by:*Fury saying on May 4, 2012 in <i>The Avengers</i>, \"Last year, Earth had a visitor from another planet who had a grudge match that levelled a small town,\" implying the Battle of Puente Antiguo was last year.*The <i>[[Thor: The Dark World Prelude]]</i> comic showing Darcy, on May 4, 2012, saying to Jane that \"it's been a year\", implying it has been a year since Thor left.*Darcy saying in <i>Thor: The Dark World</i>, \"He's gonna come back. Except, you know, last time he was gone for like, 2 years,\" seemingly referring to it being 2 years from him leaving Jane before he returned on November 11, 2013 (but potentially just meaning, \"Last time he left you, it was 2 years before he returned to Earth,\" referring to <i>The Avengers</i>).*The 2011 song <i>Walk</i> by Foo Fighters playing in a bar which Thor and Selvig visit during <i>Thor</i>.Fury's Big Week is 6 months after \"I am Iron Man\". This is shown from:*Justin Hammer saying in <i>Iron Man 2</i>, \"We all know why we're here. In the last 6 months, Anthony Stark has created a sword with untold possibilities.\"*Marvel's timeline showing that both the Ambush in Rio de Janeiro (which is shown in <i>The Incredible Hulk</i> to be \"17 days\" before Banner arrived at Culver University on Day 3 of Fury's Big Week) and the Duel of Monaco (which is days before Fury's Big Week) were 6 months after \"I am Iron Man\".*<i>Iron Man 2</i> beginning with \"I am Iron Man\" and showing a montage of Vanko working, then showing \"6 months later\", the Stark Expo opening. Jon Favreau confirmed on the DVD commentary that the Vanko montage covers the 6 months, with \"6 months later\" referring to the time since \"I am Iron Man\".*Pepper joking in Monaco that Christine Everhart slept with Tony \"last year\" (which was 9 months before \"I am Iron Man\").*The inspired canon <i>The Avengers: Iron Man Mark VII</i> comic showing about 197 days between the test flight with the icing problem and the Battle at Stark Expo.So, <i>Iron Man</i> is set in February-November of 2008 or 2009, Fury's Big Week is set in May-June of 2010 or 2011, and Fury's Big Week is 6 months after \"I am Iron Man\".<br>The best solution possible, to satisfy the most evidence with the most importance, is reasoned out as <i>Iron Man</i> being set from February-November 2009 and Fury's Big Week being set in May-June 2010.

This would then put \"Day 1\", shown to be the day of the test flight with the icing problem, on November 15, 2009, which lines up perfectly with the fact that <i>[[Iron Man (film)|Iron Man]]</i> presents the party the following day as being November 16, 2009, and then \"I am Iron Man\" being November 25, 2009 (see other references). The comic does contain recounts of the Battle of Gulmira and the Duel of Los Angeles on \"Day 23\" and \"Day 30\" respectively, but unlike with the test flight and the Duel of Monaco, shown actually playing out, they only appear as recounts. Because of the strong evidence putting the films in their November and May placements, this should not affect the timeline, but instead just be considered as Tony recounting those events during December, allowing the timeline to work out perfectly."

    "name": "IM November Placement",
    "desc": "In <i>[[Iron Man (film)|Iron Man]]</i>, the second half of the film is set over several days in November 2009. This comes from the fact that on the day of the senate meeting in <i>Iron Man 2</i>, May 8, 2010, it is said to have been 6 months since Iron Man surfaced, and Marvel's timeline shows that the Ambush in Rio de Janeiro, May 14, 2009, and the Duel of Monaco, May 23, 2010, are 6 months since \"I am Iron Man\". Together, these three would put \"I am Iron Man\" around November 15, 2009. At the party where Tony dances with Pepper and Tony discovers Obadiah has gone behind his back, Coulson arranges a meeting for \"the 24th.\" He then shows up for the meeting as Pepper escapes with the USB with Obadiah's information, the day of the Duel of Los Angeles. \"I am Iron Man\" is the day after, putting it on the 25th of its month. The closest 25th to November 15, 2009 is November 25, 2009, which also works as 6 months before May 2010 by the general math of \"November 2009 + 6 months = May 2010\". The party scene has to be within October 25-November 22, 2009, as these are the only dates on which Coulson simply saying \"the 24th\" fits as November 24th. On the night of the party, Tony checks his watch before he leaves. While it does not give a month, it shows the date as Thursday 16th. The Thursday might not line up, but the 16th lines up perfectly, being November 16th. This lines up perfectly with the <i>The Avengers: Iron Man Mark VII</i> comic. It has been established that its \"Day 189\" was May 22, 2010, as Tony left for Monaco, and its \"Day 199\" was June 1, 2010, the day after the Battle at Stark Expo. This would put its \"Day 1\", which is shown to be the day of the test flight, on November 15, 2009, lining up as the day before the party on the 16th, as it presented in the film."

Taking Alice Eve's age at the time of filming and working back from the setting, Mary Walker would have been born around September 1981. Given that she then could have joined the army no earlier than September 1998, the earliest she could have been kidnapped then would be January 1, 2006 (and calling it \"8 years\" in the general sense of \"2006 - 1998 = 8\") making the middle of her imprisonment roughly early December 2006 at the earliest. In <i>[[Citadel on the Edge of Vengeance]]</i>, it is said that Walker's escape was \"years ago\", making it roughly late 2015 at the latest, so the middle of her imprisonment roughly January 2015 at the latest. Using the mid-point of this window to approximate, the middle of her imprisonment can therefore be calculated to be roughly December 21, 2010, making her imprisonment roughly January 21, 2010-November 21, 2011.

    "desc": "In <i>[[Iron Man 2]]</i>, the scenes before Tony's birthday are set before Fury's Big Week begins. This scene is Day 1, May 29, 2010, with May 29th being Tony's birthday, as given on a file in a deleted scene from <i>The Avengers</i>, and the same file displayed at an event, and lining up with the other evidence.<br>The <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20100420085102/http://www.starkexpo2010.com/\"><i>Stark Expo 2010</i> website</a> had Stark Expo supposedly starting on May 7, 2010. This just about lines up with the May 29th date. On the day Stark promotes Pepper, it is shown clearly in the background that there is \"362 days remaining\" of the Expo. On the date of the Expo battle, there is clearly \"343 days remaining\", so there is 19 days between these dates. It can then be seen that it takes Tony 4 days to return home after the senate, 5 days after the Expo opens. This would mean there is an opening day, 365 days of normal Expo, then the closing day, plus counting inclusively (ie. on closing day it says \"1 day remaining\"), meaning there is \"367 days remaining\" on May 7th, and thus 5 days later on the 12th, \"362 days remaining\". This way, these two dates gel very nicely.<br>So, with the opening on May 7, 2010, Pepper's hiring on May 12, 2010, and Tony's birthday on May 29, 2010, somewhere between the May 12th and May 29th dates is Monaco. Monaco cannot be on May 1st/2nd like in real life, as it does not fit within these limits. But that is fine, as the <i>Marvel Cinematic Universe</i> is a different universe, so it can be different. It is still in the same ballpark as the real world. In an adaptation comic of <i>Iron Man 2</i>, in the same scene where Rhodey confronts Tony about Vanko having attacked him \"yesterday\", \"Natalie\" then comes downstairs to say Tony's guests are arriving, and they have the discussion about Tony asking what she would do if she knew it were <i>her</i> last birthday. This would put Monaco the day before his birthday. However, this scene actually contradicts the film, which depicts the Rhodey conversation and the \"Natalie\" conversation as separate scenes in separate rooms. It can be put down to the adaptation condensing the film (like the <i>Iron Man</i> one putting Coulson asking for a meeting on \"the 24th\" at Tony's returning press conference rather than the party months later), and ignore this. The <i>The Avengers: Iron Man Mark VII</i> comic implies that \"Day 189\" is the day before Monaco, putting Monaco on Day 190. It implies as well that \"Day 199\" is around 2 days after Day 3 of Fury's Big Week, putting that on Day 5. This would put Day 1 around the Mark VII Day 195, 5 days after Monaco, therefore putting Monaco around May 24, 2010. However, it would work better on the 23rd, because the Grand Prix de Monaco Historique was held on a Saturday-Sunday in the real world, so it would make sense for it to be a Saturday-Sunday in the MCU as well. May 23, 2010 was a Sunday. The second day of the Grand Prix de Monaco Historique, in the real world, is supposed to be 2 weeks before the main Monaco Grand Prix (in this case, 2 weeks before May 16, 2010 - May 2, 2010). There is still some logic if the Grand Prix de Monaco Historique second day were 1 week after the main Grand Prix as a sort of after-party, rather than a build-up, which works as May 23rd. Plus, if Monaco is the 23rd, this puts \"Day 189\" on May 22, 2010, which then puts \"Day 199\" on June 1, 2010, the day after the Battle at Stark Expo, still working, and puts \"Day 1\" on November 15, 2009, which works perfectly with the timeline of <i>Iron Man</i> (see other references)."

Then in the <i>[[Runaways (TV series)|Runaways]]</i> episode <i>[[Destiny]]</i> it was confirmed, as Nico Minoru says, \"You guys haven't had date night since the Obama Administration.\"<br>In December 2012, Aldrich Killian refers to President Ellis and says, \"After years dodging the President's ban,\" implying Ellis has been president for years. Killian is also angry at Ellis' lack of involvement in the <i>Norco</i> incident, \"2 years ago.\" It can also be assumed that Ellis was president when Steve woke in October 2011, as it is shown in <i>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</i> that he is quoted as welcoming Steve back to the world.<br>In April 2015, Grant Ward says in <i>[[A Fractured House]]</i> that if his brother Christian were allowed to take him, his trial should then \"wrap up right before the midterms\".

Therefore, Obama would have been elected in November 2008. In May 2010, during Obama's presidency, Stark has a poster resembling Obama's.

In <i>[[The Avengers]]</i>, Steve says, \"I slept for 70 years.\" The 70 can easily be simply interpreted as a rounded decade, and this is corroborated by what he says in <i>[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]</i>, \"slept for 65 years.\" This is more specific than the 70, so overall it seems that the suggestion is that he slept for around 66¾ years. With him going into the ice in March 4, 1945, this would imply that he woke around December 2011. In the <i>Fury's Big Week</i> comic, it is shown that Steve was found \"one year later\" after Day 7 of Fury's Big Week, which is June 4, 2010. This would imply that he woke around June 2011. The general, approximate real time setting of the <i>[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]</i> would suggest that he woke around July 2011. In <i>The Avengers</i>, when Steve is brought into the mission on May 2, 2012, it seems he has been awake only a few months, implying that he woke around late 2011-early 2012.<br>The best solution possible, to satisfy the most evidence with the most importance possible, is reasoned out as the modern day events of <i>Captain America: The First Avenger</i> being set from October 5-8, 2011.

Taking Alice Eve's age at the time of filming and working back from the setting, Mary Walker would have been born around September 1981. Given that she then could have joined the army no earlier than September 1998, the earliest she could have been kidnapped then would be January 1, 2006 (and calling it \"8 years\" in the general sense of \"2006 - 1998 = 8\") making the middle of her imprisonment roughly early December 2006 at the earliest. In <i>[[Citadel on the Edge of Vengeance]]</i>, it is said that Walker's escape was \"years ago\", making it roughly late 2015 at the latest, so the middle of her imprisonment roughly January 2015 at the latest. Using the mid-point of this window to approximate, the middle of her imprisonment can therefore be calculated to be roughly December 21, 2010, making her imprisonment roughly January 21, 2010-November 21, 2011.

This all takes place before January 20, 2014, the firm date for when Reva Connors is killed (see [[2014]] references). Ideally, it would be a good few months at least before her death. However, in <i>[[Can't Front on Me]]</i>, Shades says, \"My last year in Seagate, me and Comanche got paid by this juiced-in-guard, Rackham, to beat the shit out of some guy named Carl Lucas.\" In <i>[[Code of the Streets]]</i>, in November 2015 (see [[2015]] references), Shades says, \"I just got home [...] Three years this time, Seagate,\" suggesting he was released in late 2015, so his \"last year in Seagate\" would start in late 2014, but Cage is already out and Connors is already dead by then. If Shades is taken to be very loosely meaning \"just\" when he says \"just got home\", you could maybe take it that he got home a little earlier in 2015, but still, this does not work, with Cage escaping absolutely no later than January 2014. At a stretch, it can be taken that Shades is referring to the calendar year of 2014 as his last year at Seagate, released in the first half of 2015, so only a few months in and with 2015 not counting as his last \"year\" - and he is also only meaning \"just\" loosely, back for about half a year. With this, it would mean that his second attack on Lucas/Cage, the attack that he is referring to, can be in January 2014 and still loosely fit his statement. However, with Connors killed on January 20, 2014, this is very late for Lucas/Cage's escape. At an absolute minimum, they spend a few weeks together after the escape and before her death. So, all things considered, the attack can be dated to January 1, 2014, just about fitting Shades' statement at a stretch, and allowing Cage and Connors 18 days (2nd-20th), as much as possible, living freely together before her death. This makes Lucas/Cage nearly attacking Comanche roughly November 1, 2013, and his first day at Seagate roughly July 1, 2013, based on hair growth. The rest of the flashbacks in <i>Step in the Arena</i> are placed between July 2013 and January 2014 accordingly."

    "desc": "In <i>[[3 AM]]</i> and <i>[[Two Dead Men]]</i>, flashbacks are shown of Frank Castle spending time with his children some time before their deaths. As mentioned in <i>[[Penny and Dime]]</i>, his family were killed the day after he got back from a rotation, which is said in <i>[[Home]]</i> to have been Operation Cerberus in Kandahar. Therefore, these scenes cannot be between his return and their deaths, so must be before Castle left for Kandahar, which is dated to September 14, 2013 (see other references). There is a further scene in <i>[[Memento Mori]]</i> with the family spending time with Billy Russo at the Central Park carousel, which does not present clearly whether it is the day of the family's deaths or a previous time. However, Maria and Frank Jr.'s clothes are different in this scene than when they are shown on the day of their death in later flashbacks in <i>Memento Mori</i>, suggesting it is a different day and therefore before Kandahar. As well as this, Russo says in <i>[[Virtue of the Vicious]]</i> on December 12, 2016 that he has not seen Castle for a \"couple years now\". As he wants to cover up the fact that he has recently spoken with Castle, he is saying that the last time that he had seen Castle before the last month is in fact the last time he had seen him, therefore meaning that the last time Castle and Russo saw each other was late 2014, so the <i>Memento Mori</i> scene cannot be in 2015. Finally, in <i>3 AM</i>, it is shown that Maria Castle woke Frank at 10:30 on the day of their deaths, and in <i>[[Kinbaku]]</i> it is said that the massacre was at midday, so there would not be the time for them to get ready, go to Central Park, have Russo join them for a chunk of time, then have Russo leave before midday.<br>So, these three scenes all take place before the Kandahar deployment, which began on September 14, 2013 (see other references). However, both children look the same as they do in April 2015 (due to the scenes being filmed at the same time), so it can be assumed that they took place in the weeks preceding the Kandahar placement, to get them as close as possible to 2015. Castle has a buzz cut in the <i>3 AM</i> and <i>Two Dead Men</i> scenes but longer hair in the <i>Memento Mori</i> scene. The military buzz cut is likely shortly after or shortly before a deployment, and since, as explained, the scenes should be as late as possible (Summer 2013) and not as far back as 2012 (when Castle got back from his last deployment), the <i>Memento Mori</i> scene should therefore be placed preceding the other two, before Castle shaved his head ahead of his deployment. It can finally be reasoned that the <i>3 AM</i> and <i>Memento Mori</i> scenes take place around the weekend before September 14, 2013, September 7-8, 2013, and the <i>Memento Mori</i> scene approximated as the weekend before, around September 1, 2013."

It was called Cerberus.\" Therefore, Kandahar was Castle's final deployment. However, in <i>[[Kinbaku]]</i>, Ellison's statements firmly place the Massacre at Central Park on April 4, 2015 (see [[2015]] references), and in <i>[[Penny and Dime]]</i>, Castle explains that this was the day after he got back from his final deployment. It must therefore be assumed that after Castle attacked William Rawlins on November 16th, similarly to how Russo \"requested a transfer back to Force\", Castle either requested to move or was forced to for his damaging attack on a superior officer, and had to serve an extra few months before finishing on April 3, 2015. This therefore makes the November that the Kandahar events take place November 2014.<br>In <i>[[Crosshairs]]</i>, Frank Castle says \"we did 15-month rotations in Afghanistan\". Since they were due to finish on December 14, 2014, it can therefore be assumed that the deployment began around September 14, 2013. This also aligns with the fact that Castle says on November 15, 2014, \"We have been doing it for a year,\" as it would have been 14 months.<br>Finally, the assassination of Ahmad Zubair takes place somewhere between the September 14, 2013 start of the operation and the November 15, 2014 abrupt ending, so it can be approximated as roughly halfway between, around the night of April 15-16, 2014."

This all takes place before January 20, 2014, the firm date for when Reva Connors is killed (see other references). Ideally, it would be a good few months at least before her death. However, in <i>[[Can't Front on Me]]</i>, Shades says, \"My last year in Seagate, me and Comanche got paid by this juiced-in-guard, Rackham, to beat the shit out of some guy named Carl Lucas.\" In <i>[[Code of the Streets]]</i>, in November 2015 (see [[2015]] references), Shades says, \"I just got home [...] Three years this time, Seagate,\" suggesting he was released in late 2015, so his \"last year in Seagate\" would start in late 2014, but Cage is already out and Connors is already dead by then. If Shades is taken to be very loosely meaning \"just\" when he says \"just got home\", you could maybe take it that he got home a little earlier in 2015, but still, this does not work, with Cage escaping absolutely no later than January 2014. At a stretch, it can be taken that Shades is referring to the calendar year of 2014 as his last year at Seagate, released in the first half of 2015, so only a few months in and with 2015 not counting as his last \"year\" - and he is also only meaning \"just\" loosely, back for about half a year. With this, it would mean that his second attack on Lucas/Cage, the attack that he is referring to, can be in January 2014 and still loosely fit his statement. However, with Connors killed on January 20, 2014, this is very late for Lucas/Cage's escape. At an absolute minimum, they spend a few weeks together after the escape and before her death. So, all things considered, the attack can be dated to January 1, 2014, just about fitting Shades' statement at a stretch, and allowing Cage and Connors 18 days (2nd-20th), as much as possible, living freely together before her death. This makes Lucas/Cage nearly attacking Comanche roughly November 1, 2013, and his first day at Seagate roughly July 1, 2013, based on hair growth. The rest of the flashbacks in <i>Step in the Arena</i> are placed between July 2013 and January 2014 accordingly."

A year prior to this places the scene in approximately late May 2014. Late May fits very nicely with Talbot's statement that Coulson and S.H.I.E.L.D. \"managed to evade [Talbot and the military] for an entire winter.\" While this initially would suggest <i>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</i> takes place in November 2013 and <i>Shadows</i> picks up in March 2014, this is not possible, with it having to occur in 2014 (various time references in <i>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</i>: Season 1 to spanning several months from September 2013 and a couple of months following <i>Thor: The Dark World</i>, \"2 years\" in <i>Captain America: Civil War</i>, see other references for more details). With the suggested timespan of <i>Seeds</i> to <i>Yes Men</i> putting <i>Yes Men</i> in early January 2014, it fits nicely with the end of <i>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</i>: Season 1 following <i>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</i> immediately in mid-January. It can then be assumed that Talbot is referring to the remainder of winter (January-early March), and with it being now spring moving into summer, winter has come to a resolute, \"entire\" close. In <i>Shadows</i>, Coulson states, \"Our plane's been gathering dust for months.\" The last time the Bus was used was January 18, 2014, which fits as 4½ months later. He also states that \"in the months since [Simmons left], [Fitz has] grown isolated.\" The reasoned date for Simmons leaving is January 30, 2014, which fits as 4 months later. Brett Dalton also is <a href=\"http://tvline.com/2015/01/15/agents-of-shield-skye-ward-shooting-spoilers/\">quoted as saying, \"Ward had a hell of a time in the cage by himself for 6 months, he had some suicidal tendencies, and once he comes to the end of wrestling with all of his demons, he makes a promise; to reunite Skye with her dad.\"</a> The suicidal tendencies etc. refers to where we pick up in <i>Shadows</i>, but the promise to Skye is <i>[[Making Friends and Influencing People]]</i>. With that episode being mid-September (see other references to the stretch between <i>[[Heavy is the Head]]</i> and <i>[[A Fractured House]]</i>), the middle of these two dates - late May and mid-September, is mid-to-late July, which works nicely as 6 months after mid-January. With Talbot going for a walk with his son around midday in <i>Shadows</i>, it makes sense for this to be a Sunday, thereby finally dating it as May 29, 2014."

    "desc": "In the episode <i>[[Daredevil (episode)|Daredevil]]</i>, Fisk is imprisoned on the reasoned date of February 16th. In <i>[[Seven Minutes in Heaven]]</i>, flashbacks are shown chronicling his time in prison between February 16th and November 17th. From Donovan telling Fisk his case is not going well to Fisk telling Donovan to help out Finney and the Valdezes' families seems to be not long after his imprisonment, due to his wounds having not healed too much. It is a slow, scarring heal though, as is evident from the remaining scar in November. It is shown that he has a notepad beginning on \"10/12\", and the next notepad has a \"10/24\" date on page 6. With the notepads approximately 20 pages long, this is 5 complete pages in, ¼, so 1¼ pads is about 12 days, meaning one pad is about 10 days.<br>Fisk is shown keeping his pads in stacks of four. About 13 pads can be seen in Fisk's cell, three stacks of 4 plus one he holds that he then puts on top. Where he's sitting, he appears to be obscuring another stack, and if not, there may well be another in his bedside cabinet, so he is roughly on his 17th pad on November 14th. So, a pad began on October 12th, meaning another around October 22nd, another around November 1st, and another, the 17th, around November 11th. Therefore, working backwards, the 1st pad began around June 4th.<br>With Donovan telling Fisk his case is not going well on Day 1 and Fisk telling Donovan to help out Finney and the Valdezes' families on Day 5, Day 3 can then be approximately placed halfway between February 16th and June 4th, around April 11th, meaning the scenes between those events are April 9th-13th. This is approximately 20% into the flashbacks, which makes sense in terms of the amount his cut has healed compared to the beginning and the end.<br>Fisk makes notes from June 4th to November 14th, when Finney approaches him to talk about the Punisher. In that scene, he also references learning about a deal made between Dutton's lieutenant and the Aryans on \"the 22nd\", assumed to refer to the most recent 22nd - October 22nd. This matches almost perfectly with the fact that the exact note can be seen in his notepad on \"10/24\" (assuming he just noted it 2 days later)."

However, Derrickson also says that Strange recovers for 3-6 months, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYxmUMCNxCo\">Mads Mikkelsen says Strange trains for \"9 months\" before his clash with Kaecilius</a>, which overall would suggest the film ends 12-15 months after Strange's car crash, thus placing the ending around February-May 2017. This, in turn, using Derrickson's comment about \"a little over a year\" (\"early\" one season to  \"late\" the same season a year later would mean 4⅔ seasons, so about 14 months), would, working backwards, place the opening of the film between December 2015 and February 2016 (the latest it can be, before Strange's car crash).<br>Overall, using weighted math from all the evidence available, the details of which can be seen [[User:Marvelus/Phase Three Timeline#Doctor Strange|here]], the result is that the opening is October 13, 2015, the car crash February 2, 2016, the argument with Christine March 29, 2016, Strange's arrival in Kathmandu May 4, 2016, and the climax January 18-19, 2017.<br>This would put the opening still in the early part of fall (working with Derrickson's comment), the argument with Christine towards the end of the snowy period and a bit after winter, but enough time after Strange's crash and a good time for the heavy rain (a bit later than Derrickson's comment but realistic), his arrival in Kathmandu 3 months after his crash (just fitting inside Derrickson's 3-6 months comment), the climax another 8.5 months later (just fitting for Mikkelsen's \"9 months\" comment), and the climax a bit after Fall 2016, instead Winter 2016-17 (a bit later than Derrickson's comment) but fitting as \"a little over a year\" (15 months) after the opening (fitting reasonably with Derrickson's comment), a realistic time of year for the snowfall at the Ancient One's death, and working with the other comments just described. This also works fine considering Derrickson made it clear he did not want to be fully held to his comments.<br>The specific dates of smaller events in between can also be found [[User:Marvelus/Phase Three Timeline#Filling in the Gaps|here]]."

It has to be no earlier than November 18, 2015, as Wilder and Minoru played <i>Star Wars Battlefront</i> for a while before Minoru's death, and that was released on November 17, 2015. It can be assumed that the annual sacrifice is usually on a Friday early in December, as it is in 2017, making it either Friday 4th or Friday 11th in 2015. When Wilder logs onto the PlayStation, it says that the last time Minoru played the game was \"2 years ago\". The system for such operating systems is to round to the nearest integer below the exact number of years it has been, which means that \"2 years ago\" means between 2.000 and 2.999 years, so the last time Minoru played was no later than December 7, 2015, meaning her death, being later that evening, cannot have been later than December 7, 2015. Therefore, the most fitting date for the sacrifice and Minoru's death is Friday, December 4, 2015."

However, a Chinese festival appearing in <i>Snow Gives Way</i> includes lion and dragon dances and the zodiac monkey mask (2016 was indeed the Year of the Monkey), all heavily suggesting that the festival is Chinese New Year. This lines up with the other, broader evidence.<br>Charlie Cox is quoted as saying <i>The Defenders</i>: Season 1 is 6 months after <i>Daredevil</i>: Season 2 (<a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/television/1685619/why-matt-murdock-doesnt-want-to-be-daredevil-anymore-when-the-defenders-begins\">1</a>, <a href=\"http://comicbook.com/marvel/2017/07/31/daredevil-season-2-charlie-cox-missing-scene/\">2</a>), which would place that season around May/June 2016, and the overall result of Finn Jones and Jessica Henwick's comments about the time between <i>[[Dragon Plays with Fire]]</i> and <i>[[The Defenders]]</i>: [[The Defenders/Season One|Season 1]] suggested a little over 2 months' span (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obGSvaYP1VA\">\"several months\"</a>, <a href=\"http://screenrant.com/defenders-colleen-wing-jessica-henwick-story/\">\"1 month\"</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pressreader.com/uk/empire-uk/20170801/282510068602588\">\"about 2 months\"</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kdq7xbftTbs\">\"a couple of months\"</a>), which, working back, would indeed line up with <i>Dragon Plays with Fire</i> ending in March 2016. <i>[[Worst Behavior]]</i> also shows that by <i>The Defenders</i>: Season 1, Elektra's resurrection (December 25, 2015) was \"months ago\", and it is said in the season that Danny leaving for K'un-Lun/starting to go after the Hand were both also \"months\" prior. The fact that the same timespan is given since both <i>[[A Cold Day in Hell's Kitchen]]</i> and <i>[[Dragon Plays with Fire]]</i> would suggest that the events are close together, within 2-3 months of each other, certainly not 7 months apart.<br>Using Chinese New Year, which lines up with this more important evidence, the season revolves around February 8, 2016 (Chinese New Year 2016)."

There is a tiny, unfocused laptop date of \"11/07/2016\" in <i>[[The H Word]]</i>, which is most likely simply the date of filming. This is overruled by the fact that if the season began on November 6th, it would run in November to the point where it clashes with hard dates stated in <i>The Punisher</i>: Season 1 - with Karen Page being in two places at once. It is also overruled by evidence for it being earlier in the year:<br>Charlie Cox was quoted as saying, <a href=\"http://ew.com/tv/2017/01/13/defenders-charlie-cox-daredevil-interview/\">\"Well, it's been a few months since the end of Season 2. I think it's been quite a challenging few months for him.\"</a> This would place the season only a few months after November/December 2015 (depending on whether he is referring to the climax or the epilogue), when <i>Daredevil</i>: Season 2 comes to an end. He later stated, <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/television/1685619/why-matt-murdock-doesnt-want-to-be-daredevil-anymore-when-the-defenders-begins\">\"At the end of <i>Daredevil</i> Season 2, everyone failed. Matt failed, and the consequences were devastating. Six or so months have passed, and he's had to completely reevaluate everything that he believes, everything that he does.\"</a> Six months would place <i>The Defenders</i>: Season 1 around May/June 2016. He added later, <a href=\"http://comicbook.com/marvel/2017/07/31/daredevil-season-2-charlie-cox-missing-scene/\">\"In the 6 months since <i>Daredevil</i> ended and this show begins, there is so much stuff that I would like to have explored,\"</a> again placing it in May/June. It is confirmed in the show that it has been months since the epilogue of <i>Daredevil</i>: Season 2, with it flashing back to its events, \"Months ago...\"<br>Finn Jones and Jessica Henwick provided some slightly contradictory information about the amount of time it has been since <i>Iron Fist</i>: Season 1. Henwick said, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obGSvaYP1VA\">\"It takes place several months after <i>Iron Fist</i>...\"</a> She later said, <a href=\"http://screenrant.com/defenders-colleen-wing-jessica-henwick-story/\">\"We pick up with Colleen not in New York - which is crazy, as all the shows have been predominantly in New York. We find her a month after we left her,\"</a> and, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kdq7xbftTbs\">\"We pick up, I would say a couple months after we left.\"</a> Finn Jones stated in <a href=\"https://www.pressreader.com/uk/empire-uk/20170801/282510068602588\"><i>Empire</i> magazine, \"It's about two months after <i>Iron Fist</i> finishes.\"</a> Overall, it can be taken that it is about 2-2½ months. <i>Iron Fist</i>: Season 1 finishes on March 1, 2016, and so this would suggest it is around May 2016. In <i>[[The H Word]]</i>, Danny says, \"We've been chasing the Hand for months,\" referring to the time since March 1st. In <i>[[Worst Behavior]]</i>, Alexandra says, \"Danny Rand has been running around off the grid for months,\" referring to the time since he left on February 27th.<br>These timespans would suggest around late May 2016. However, in <i>[[Ashes, Ashes]]</i>, it is shown that there are a few small lumps of snow leftover from a reasonably recent snowfall. This would place it earlier in the year. We know from <i>[[Self Control]]</i>, which is firmly no earlier than late April 2017, that it is perhaps a little more commong for there to be snowfall in late April in the <i>MCU</i> than the real world, so it is just about possible that there was an April snowfall, and it is now early May. There is also a calendar in the precinct through the season, which is a Sunday-Saturday calendar (as the same type is shown up close in <i>[[A Cold Day in Hell's Kitchen]]</i>), where the days matching the dates, and the fact it has 31 days, would mean it is a March 2016 calendar. We know from <i>A Cold Day in Hell's Kitchen</i> that the precinct calendars can fall behind a couple of months (as in that episode, between scenes, it is flipped from September 2015 to December).<br>Overall, it can be taken that the season takes place around early May 2016, after Lagos. This is 6 months after Elektra's death in the climax of <i>Daredevil</i>: Season 2, as Cox stated, and a couple of months after <i>Iron Fist</i>: Season 1's ending, as Henwick and Jones have implied, and as the show states. There was a late snowfall in April, and there is a little compacted snow left, and the calendar is a little behind. This also fits with the feel and dialogue implications of the timespan since <i>Luke Cage</i>: Season 1, minimising the gap between <i>Jessica Jones</i>: Season 1 and the season (which is implied to be recent), and allowing Karen 6 months to have moved past her mourning for Matt by the time she appears in <i>The Punisher</i>: Season 1.<br>On Day 3 and Day 8 of the season, Trish Talk appears, which is reaffirmed in the season to be a weekday show. This means they are either Wednesday 4th and Monday 9th, Thursday 5th and Tuesday 10th, or Friday 6th and Wednesday 11th. If it is the Friday and Wednesday, this allows the New York parts to begin 2 days after Lagos, allowing it to not be top news, but also adding an extra reason why, on Day 3, Trish Talk listeners are concerned about terrorist attacks because of recent events. This also fits with the Trish Talk team going to lunch on Day 5, the 8th, as it would be a Sunday and so they are not on air.<br>Therefore, the season takes place approximately from May 4-14, 2016."

Nelson is composed enough to discuss legal stuff with Cage and Temple, suggesting it's been several days since Murdock's death - at least 4, which would make it at least May 13, 2016. However, 2 scenes later is Jones talking to Cage, and she says that \"it's been a hell of a week\". The main events for her began on May 4, 2016, suggesting this is May 11, 2016. To compromise, both scenes (and the scene in between with Misty in hospital) are May 12, 2016. This gives 3 days for Nelson to recover a little, and means that Jones is only slightly rounding when she says \"a week\", since it has been 8 days. The next scene with Rand and Wing is also that day. Then, at Matt Murdock's memorial service, Foggy Nelson says \"it's been days\" since Murdock's apparent death. It is placed as the day after the last 4 scenes, May 13, 2016, 4 days since Murdock's death."

    "desc": "In <i>[[Captain America: Civil War]]</i>, it is shown that some time after T'Challa returned home to Wakanda, he harbored Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes and allowed Barnes to be cryogenically frozen while his people worked on a potential solution. This therefore has to occur after T'Challa's return to Wakanda on June 30, 2016.<br>However, on July 3, 2016, Shuri says, \"Great! Another broken white boy for us to fix.\" This is a reference to her work on Bucky Barnes, which suggests that she has begun work on him by July 3, 2016. There is no space between July 1st and July 3rd in which she could have been helping Barnes as soon as all the problems with Klaue began, so the only options are that either this scene takes place in the day between T'Challa's coronation and the Klaue situation beginning, June 30th-July 1st, or after the main events of <i>Black Panther</i>, July 7th or later. If it is the latter, the assumption has to be made that Shuri has begun the project either because she has been informed of Barnes' problem or even because Barnes has arrived in Wakanda and is being hidden (though that takes more assumption and is implausible considering his absence during the events of the film).<br>The ultimate answer comes in the <i>[[Avengers: Infinity War Prelude]]</i>, where it is shown that after the escape from the Raft on June 26, 2016, Rogers and Barnes spent approximately 2 days helping their friends as Lang and Barton arranged their house arrest deals (explained in <i>[[Avengers: Infinity War]]</i> and <i>[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]</i>) then were dropped home, and it was arranged that Wanda Maximoff would meet in secret with Vision, and then she was dropped off to meet with him around June 28, 2016. Following this, it is then shown that \"weeks later\", Barnes and Rogers speak with T'Challa in Wakanda, and then T'Challa takes Barnes to be frozen. This therefore means the <i>Captain America: Civil War</i> scene cannot be June 30th or July 1st, as this would be merely 2-3 days later, meaning it has to be after the events of <i>Black Panther</i>, and Shuri is merely talking about having begun her work on the project to fix Barnes' mental conditioning.<br>The scene is presented as being not long after Rogers' fight with Stark on June 24, 2016, as he still has some bruising on his face. \"Weeks\" realistically implies at least 2½ or so weeks, and it should not be more than that considering the bruising, so overall, the scene is placed just over 2½ weeks, 18 days later, on July 16, 2016 (3 weeks after Rogers' fight with Stark, between T'Challa kissing Nakia and T'Challa taking Shuri to Oakland)."

    "desc": "In <i>[[Behold…The Inhumans!]]</i>, it is shown that the Terrigen outbreak from <i>[[S.O.S. Part Two]]</i> is ongoing. It is also referenced as being \"recent\". In <i>[[Laws of Nature]]</i>, it is shown on a detailed simulation that the Terrigen dispersal will be complete 17 months and 21 days after it started, on May 9, 2015. This would place its completion around October 30, 2016, suggesting that Day 1 of the show takes place before this. While it is possible that it occurs after, with the Terrigen still in the water, it is unlikely, especially with the outbreak still \"recent\". In <i>[[The Gentleman's Name is Gorgon]]</i>, Audrey references the Sokovia Accords, asking Crystal if the Inhuman royal family should \"be on a register or something.\" This places Day 5 of the show after June 22, 2016, when the Accords were ratified. Overall, this suggests that Day 3 is approximately August 26, 2016, the midpoint between these dates. On Day 3, in <i>[[Divide -- And Conquer]]</i>, Medusa picks up that day's paper, and it is a Sunday edition. The closest Sunday is August 28, 2016, therefore placing the show approximately around that date, from August 26-31, 2016. This also matches a report claiming that <a href=\"http://comicbook.com/marvel/2017/09/04/marvels-inhumans-spoilers-agents-shield-connections/#4\">Scott Buck said the royal family are aware of Quake</a>. Quake would have caused several incidents at this point and become public knowledge. Makani also says in <i>[[Those Who Would Destroy Us]]</i> that Gorgon \"must be one of those Inhumans I've read about.\" There is not a clear moment in <i>[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]</i> that Inhumans become public knowledge, but it is safe to say that by Quake's incidents, the public is aware."

    "desc": "In <i>[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]</i>, the film begins after the \"two months later\" text on a school day, and the following day, the day of Liz Toomes' party, is later said to have been a Friday. What is implied to be the following school day, therefore Monday, is when Parker puts the tracker on Toomes' men. The next day (as Parker has to rush, he has not had another day to ask), Parker rejoins the decathlon team as they leave, the day before the competition. A poster early in the film says that the decathlon will be on October 13-15, and at that point Mr. Harrington also asks if Parker cannot spare one weekend for it. However, later, another poster is more clearly shown with the date of September 14th, which makes more sense with all the other evidence and is more prominent and presumably newer, therefore this is the date for it, and the weekend mention is no longer valid as the date must have been changed since then. However, when they get back into school, the Washington incident is referred to on the Midtown High TV news as having happened \"this weekend\". There is an internal inconsistency here, as at least 2 days after the incident, Parker refers to Toomes' party as \"last Friday\", but it cannot be \"last Friday\" if there has been at least another school day + a \"weekend\" since the party, as well as the fact that the men coming to find the Chitauri object cannot realistically be more than the first school day after the party, and Parker rejoining the group cannot be realistically more than the day after that. With the September 14th date, which is a Wednesday, this all lines up much better as the film starting on Thursday 8th, the party being Friday 9th, Toomes' men coming on Monday 12th, Parker rejoining the group on Tuesday 13th, and then the incident on the 14th. It can be assumed that following the incident, Parker's classmates spent another day or so in Washington, D.C., and/or were not in on Friday to allow them to recover, and so they are returning on Monday, victorious, and the school news incorrectly reports it as having happened at \"the weekend\" - besides, they are presented as unreliable newsreaders. It has to be assumed either way that the \"last Friday\" is simply a Monday referring to \"not the Friday just been, but <i>last</i> Friday\". This would then be the Monday, September 19th, putting the Ambush on the Staten Island Ferry on the 20th, and the homecoming dance on Friday 23rd, which fits perfectly with <a href=\"http://imgur.com/t/Awesome/hfkqJ\">this ticket prop an extra posted a photo of</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.comicbookmovie.com/spider-man/homecoming/the-wall-crawler-strikes-a-familiar-pose-in-new-spider-man-homecoming-promo-art-a150330\">matching tickets officially on display at an event in Japan</a>. While Happy Hogan says on the 8th that he has to clear out Avengers Tower by next week, it can be assumed that he had to clear it by the Sunday ahead of some other business, before the actual moving the following Friday."

    "desc": "In <i>[[Avengers: Infinity War Prelude]]</i>, it is shown that \"months later\" after July 16, 2016, Shuri has nearly worked out how to clear Bucky Barnes' mental conditioning. Soon after this (dialogue implies it is immediately after), Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, and Sam Wilson deal with a terrorist group in Syria. A follow-up on this Syria scene in <i>[[Captain Marvel Prelude]]</i> shows it to be \"months later\" after June 24, 2016, suggesting it is late 2016-early 2017. In this scene, Fury says, \"And it ain't even Christmas yet,\" implying that it is not shortly after Christmas (early 2017), but rather not long before, so late 2016. The Shuri scene individually would ideally place around early 2017, being \"months\" after July 2016, but since it has to occur before the late 2016 Syria scenes, it has to be a little earlier than this ideal placement, also in late 2016 - which is not a problem. However, this means that the later the better - in other words, the closer to the Syria scenes, the better, which matches the implication from the dialogue in <i>Avengers: Infinity War Prelude</i>, placing the Shuri scene and the Syria events most likely on the same day, with nothing suggesting otherwise. So, these can be reasoned to take place <a href=\"https://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Thread:241334#401\">around approximately November 17, 2016</a>, 4 months after July 16, 2016 and almost 5 months after June 24, 2016, but still several weeks ahead of Christmas.<br>Shuri would have begun work on Barnes at some point between July 8, 2016 (after Killmonger's defeat) and July 16, 2016 (when he was frozen), so around July 12, 2016. With Barnes being frozen on July 16, 2016 and that helping her with her work, overall, with those first 4 or so days being roughly half as helpful, it is essentially as if her work began on July 14, 2016. Therefore, on November 17, 2016, she has been working on Barnes for roughly 126 days, and dialogue implies she is approximately 80% complete on finding and finalizing her solution. This would then imply that it would take approximately a further 32 days until Shuri was ready to wake Barnes, suggesting he was woken around December 19, 2016. Finally, the <i>Black Panther</i> post-credits scene is likely a further few days later, as he has recuperated a little and the Wakandan children are familiar with him - approximately 3 days later, giving December 22, 2016.<br>The United Nations <i>Black Panther</i> mid-credits scene therefore takes place between July 20, 2016 (approximately 15:00 Eastern, as roughly midday California) and December 22, 2016 (approximately 04:00 Eastern, as roughly midday Wakanda), giving an approximation of roughly October 5, 2016 21:30 Eastern/October 6, 2016 03:30 Vienna. Ultimately, the closest midday in Vienna day is October 6, 2016, which gives October 6, 2016 approximately 04:00 Eastern."

    "desc": "In <i>[[3 AM]]</i>, Dinah Madani asks Stein for info on \"the explosion and drug bust at the 41st Street docks last year\", referring to the [[Destruction of the Blacksmith's Ship]]. With that event in <i>[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]</i>: Season 2 firmly placed in November 2015 (with all of the first four Netflix seasons linked together in a very strong 2015 placement), this places at least the beginning of <i>[[The Punisher]]</i>: Season 1 in 2016. In <i>[[Resupply]]</i>, it is also shown that Micro has two collections of computer files - a total of 62 files - in a random order, the earliest of which is \"03/05/2015\" and the latest of which is \"10/24/2016\". In 599 days, he added 61 files, meaning that there is roughly an average of a file every 9.8 days. This would therefore suggest that early in the season, it is roughly late October/early November 2016.<br>In <i>[[Kandahar (episode)|Kandahar]]</i>, just after midnight, Micro says to Frank, \"Happy birthday, Frank. It's the 15th. Happy birthday.\" Around 36 hours later, making it the 16th of the month, in <i>Resupply</i>, Curtis says to Lewis, \"Now you're sleeping in a hole in November,\" placing that scene in November - therefore making it November 16th. This is only 8 days after Madani talked about the drug bust, making that November 8th, in which she said the drug bust was last year, making it 2016 - so, the 3rd day of the main events is November 8, 2016, and thus the main events of the season began on November 6, 2016, and the Curtis scene, on the 11th day, is November 16, 2016. With that being the same day as Micro looking at his files, that also matches with his computer, which implied around late October/early November 2016 - just roughly a fortnight later than the average approximately implied.<br>On the 19th day of the main events, in <i>[[The Judas Goat]]</i>, it is implied to be around Thanksgiving. This matches perfectly, with 18 days after November 6, 2016 being November 24, 2016 - the exact day of Thanksgiving 2016. The events continue to the end of <i>[[Cold Steel]]</i>, which takes it up to Tuesday, November 29th.<br><i>[[Front Toward Enemy]]</i> picks up a few days later, and in the opening of the episode, Lewis Wilson's bombing occurs. Later in the episode, it is stated that the bombing was on \"Tuesday\", so the bombing is Tuesday, December 6th, 7 days after <i>Cold Steel</i>. In the following episode, <i>[[Virtue of the Vicious]]</i>, the <i>Homegrown</i> newspaper is shown. On the <a href=\"http://nybulletin.com/\"><i>New York Bulletin</i> website</a>, it can be seen on that front cover that the bombing is mentioned as being \"last week\" - despite the episode being the day after Frank is revealed publicly to be alive at the end of <i>Front Toward Enemy</i> (Billy Russo says, \"Up until yesterday, I thought he was dead\"), and <i>Front Toward Enemy</i> only seemingly spanning a couple of days. Therefore, <i>Virtue of the Vicious</i> should be as early as possible to still be the week after the bombings - Monday, December 12th, and <i>Front Toward Enemy</i> is spread across 6 days for it to end on Sunday, December 11th, with some gaps placed in the episode, which is just about possible.<br>In that episode, Senator Ori also says, in a scene dated to December 11, 2016, \"It's barely a year since this city was terrorized by the Punisher.\" This matches perfectly with his attacks in <i>Daredevil</i>: Season 2 being firmly placed in October-November 2015, and again confirms that this season is in 2016. The <i>Homegrown</i> front cover from December 12, 2016, also says that Frank's trial was \"last year\", working perfectly again as 2016.<br>Working from December 12th, the rest of the season plays out, with <i>Memento Mori</i> on December 14th-15th, and the confrontation in Central Park just after midnight on the 16th. \"3 days later\" (around 80 hours after the fight), the epilogue occurs on December 19th.<br>The season, therefore, takes place from November 6, 2016 to December 19, 2016.<br>In <i>Front Toward Enemy</i>, Lewis Wilson's driving license does say that he was born on \"05/30/1991\", and Micro says that Lewis is \"age 26\", which would place the season between May 30, 2017 and May 29, 2018. However, this is overruled by all the previously listed evidence. If the season occurred in late 2017, it would contradict all of this evidence, and/or <i>Daredevil</i>: Season 2 would have to be moved to late 2016 - which in turn would drag Season 1 into early 2016 (since it is several months before Season 2), <i>[[Luke Cage (TV series)|Luke Cage]]</i>: Season 1 into late 2016 (since it overlaps with <i>Daredevil</i>: Season 2), and <i>[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]</i>: Season 1 into 2016 (since it is between Season 1 and 2 of <i>Daredevil</i>), contradicting a very large amount of evidence placing all four in 2015. Plus, Frank says earlier in the episode that he believes he's \"25 years old\", which despite being only a guess, would be correct."

This, in turn, using Derrickson's comment about \"a little over a year\" (\"early\" one season to  \"late\" the same season a year later would mean 4⅔ seasons, so about 14 months), would, working backwards, place the opening of the film between December 2015 and February 2016 (the latest it can be, before Strange's car crash).<br>Overall, using weighted math from all the evidence available, the details of which can be seen [[User:Marvelus/Phase Three Timeline#Doctor Strange|here]], the result is that the opening is October 13, 2015, the car crash February 2, 2016, the argument with Christine March 29, 2016, Strange's arrival in Kathmandu May 4, 2016, and the climax January 18-19, 2017.<br>This would put the opening still in the early part of fall (working with Derrickson's comment), the argument with Christine towards the end of the snowy period and a bit after winter, but enough time after Strange's crash and a good time for the heavy rain (a bit later than Derrickson's comment but realistic), his arrival in Kathmandu 3 months after his crash (just fitting inside Derrickson's 3-6 months comment), the climax another 8.5 months later (just fitting for Mikkelsen's \"9 months\" comment), and the climax a bit after Fall 2016, instead Winter 2016-17 (a bit later than Derrickson's comment) but fitting as \"a little over a year\" (15 months) after the opening (fitting reasonably with Derrickson's comment), a realistic time of year for the snowfall at the Ancient One's death, and working with the other comments just described. This also works fine considering Derrickson made it clear he did not want to be fully held to his comments.<br>The specific dates of smaller events in between can also be found [[User:Marvelus/Phase Three Timeline#Filling in the Gaps|here]]."

Since Season 2 takes place explicitly 8 months later in October, then it cannot be later than October 2017, making Season 1 February 2015, 2016, or 2017 - not 2018.*In <i>[[Call/Response]]</i>, a poster is up at the Wild Red Hawks for an event on \"Friday, Jan. 30\". January 30th was a Friday in 2015, though it could just be a much older poster left up for commemorative reasons.The total evidence for a February 2008 accident and February 2016 present events:*In <i>First Light</i>, security footage of Tyrone stealing the car radio says \"2007-04-18\". This does not match as any February, though it would make most sense in-universe for it to be February 2008, with the camera clock set back several months by accident due to something like a reset.*In <i>[[Suicide Sprints]]</i>, Adina Johnson's vision shows the \"missing\" dates of her children as being \"6/6/08\". The closest February is 2008, and this would make sense, for her to still be very anxious about a second child dying 4 months later, and the 6/6/08 actually being the date of her anxiety rather than the date of Billy's death.*In <i>Call/Response</i>, <i>[[Shadow Selves]]</i>, and <i>[[Rabbit Hold]]</i>, it is shown in obituaries that Billy Johnson was born on \"August 1, 1990\" and died aged \"17\", with another obituary in <i>[[Princeton Offense]]</i> also saying he was 17. If he were born in August 1990, the February where he was 17 would have been 2008.*In <i>Princeton Offense</i>, Peter Scarborough's Wikipedia page says, \"In 2009, after supervising the Roxxon cleanup effort in New Orleans following an oil rig explosion, Scarborough transitioned to a consulting position.\" This could potentially work with the accident being February 2008, with cleanup in 2008 and then Scarborough moving on in early 2009.*Jeph Loeb's statement as mentioned.*<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9d8dOY7e58&t=1382s\">Emma Lahana says this is O'Reilly's first case in New Orleans</a>. Nandi Tyler says in <i>[[Luke Cage (TV series)|Luke Cage]]</i>: [[Luke Cage (TV series)/Season Two|Season 2]], Episode 8 - <i>[[If It Ain't Rough, It Ain't Right]]</i>, set in August 2017, that O'Reilly has moved to New Orleans. In <i>[[Ghost Stories]]</i>, O'Reilly mentions events involving superheroes with her friend Misty Knight in New York, meaning it is after <i>Luke Cage</i>: [[Luke Cage (TV series)/Season One|Season 1]] in December 2015. If she moved in February 2016, this fits within this range, though it is implied that O'Reilly left during Knight's time away from the force, which would not work with February 2016 since her time off begins in May 2016.*In <i>First Light</i>, a taxi is shown with a \"11 17\" registration sticker, meaning it should be between November 2015 and November 2017.*In <i>[[Funhouse Mirrors]]</i>, Stan Bartlett's license plate says \"18\". This means that if he just renewed it in the last several weeks, it could be February 2016, with an expiry date in early 2018.The total evidence for a February 2009 accident and February 2017 present events:*In <i>First Light</i>, Nathan Bowen's work ID is valid from \"30MAR08\" to \"29MAR10\".*In <i>Suicide Sprints</i>, Adina Johnson's vision shows Tyrone's date of birth as \"8/19/00\", although Billy's says \"02\" which is definitely not his real year of birth, so it can be taken that this is not reliable either. In <i>Call/Response</i>, Season 1, Episode 4, Tyrone say, \"My parents look at me like a liar and a thief ever since I was 8. They don't trust me. Not really. You know, ever since that night.\" If his birthday is indeed August 19, 2000, then the February where he was 8 would be February 2009.*Peter Scarborough's Wikipedia page, as mentioned above, supports 2009 more than it does 2008.*In <i>Princeton Offense</i>, the oil rig schematics are shown to have been on \"9/10/2008\", suggesting the accident was after September 10, 2008.*Jeph Loeb's statement as mentioned.*As mentioned, Emma Lahana says this is O'Reilly's first case in New Orleans and O'Reilly is still in New York in December 2015 but in New Orleans by August 2017. If she moved in February 2017, this is the only February that fits perfectly since it implied that O'Reilly left during Knight's time away from the force, which began in May 2016.*The \"11 17\" taxi registration sticker as mentioned.*In <i>First Light</i>, Tyrone has a leaflet for <a href=\"https://thetvshows.us/displayimage.php?album=2594&pid=3028413#top_display_media\">\"FREE COMIC BOOK DAY 1st Saturday in May - May 6, 2017\"</a>, which would work in February 2017.*As mentioned, there is an (unreliable) August 2000 date of birth given for Tyrone in <i>Suicide Sprints</i>. In the same episode, Tyrone mentions that he has known Father Delgado for 3 years, which would suggests he is in February of junior year, meaning he was born 16.4-17.4 years ago, so since it is an August and date of birth and currently February, he would be 16.5. 16.5 years after August 2000 gives February 2017.*In <i>Call/Response</i>, a magazine says, \"Currently chairs a committee in 2017.\"*Stan Bartlett's license plate as mentioned says \"18\", which means it is between 2016 and 2018.*In <i>[[Colony Collapse]]</i>, on Mardi Gras, Scarborough references the surname Rand being a name that means you are known to be rich currently, implying Season 1, Episode 10: The Rands are referred to, suggesting Danny Rand is back in the world. Mardi Gras in 2016 was February 6th, before Danny Rand has returned, so it does not fit with 2016, but would make it February 2017 or 2018.*The basketball state finals occur days before Mardi Gras. The basketball state finals in Louisiana tend to be early March, and 2017 is the year where Mardi Gras is as close as possible to this, on February 28th.The total evidence for a February 2010 accident and February 2018 present events:*Nathan Bowen's work ID as mentioned.*The oil rig schematic revisions as mentioned.*In <i>First Light</i>, <i>Lush Life</i> by Leo Islo plays in-universe.

This is just 12 days too late to fit with February 2017, so the only possible February is 2018.*Tyrone has a \"FREE COMIC BOOK DAY 1st Saturday in May - May 6, 2017\" leaflet as mentioned, which could work with 2018 if you assume he just left it up for several months after.*In <i>Suicide Sprints</i>, Adina Johnson has the book <i>Grief Cottage</i>, which was released August 2017, so the only possible February is 2018.*As mentioned, there is an (unreliable) August 2000 date of birth given for Tyrone in <i>Suicide Sprints</i>. In <i>Rabbit Hold</i>, it is shown on a poster and stated that Tyrone is \"18\". The October where he would be 18 would be October 2018, making Season 1 February 2018.*In <i>Princeton Offense</i>, O'Reilly looks at narcotics arrest files that she describes as being from \"about 8 years ago\", and the files on screen are from \"02/18/2010\", suggesting this is February 2018.*In <i>Princeton Offense</i>, news stories from \"hours ago\" are real life news stories from September 2017. This does not work for any February, though if it has to suggest one it would be February 2018, because at least those stories have happened by then.*Stan Bartlett's license plate as mentioned says \"18\", which works so long as the plate was registered between February and December 2016.*In <i>Ghost Stories</i>, Tyrone's phone says \"Thursday, October 5\". October 5th was a Thursday in 2017, and was the day of filming. This does not work for any February, though if it has to suggest one it would be February 2018, because it is more likely if the phone has the wrong date that it would be a past date, not a future one, if the phone was accidentally reset or something similar.*Scarborough's reference to the Rands as mentioned.*In <i>[[Alignment Chart]]</i>, an obituary for Kenneth Fuchs says, \"Fuchs, aged 32, passed away on February 11, 2018.\"Overall, when weighing up the value of each piece of evidence and the specificity and making compromises, February 2009/2017 comes out as the strongest option."

It can be assumed because the teams in the final are different as well, that it did indeed occur on a different date. It would occur on a Sunday, meaning the end of <i>[[Uprising (episode)|Uprising]]</i> would be a Thursday, with little time between <i>Uprising</i> and <i>[[Let Me Stand Next to Your Fire]]</i>, which is dated to April 3rd.

This fits with the fact that when Jones looks at her diary from her old home in <i>[[AKA Top Shelf Perverts]]</i>, it is shown to have been her \"1996-1999\" diary, with infrequent entries, the last of which was in September 1999.<br>A 2000 date for the car crash was supported by [[Jessica Jones (TV series)/Season Two|Season 2]], when, in Episode 1 - <i>[[AKA Start at the Beginning]]</i>, Phillip Jones' ashes box says \"Birth/Death Year: 1990-2000\", and when, in Episode 2 - <i>[[AKA Freak Accident]]</i> and Episode 3 - <i>[[AKA Sole Survivor]]</i>, it is show on death certificates that Brian Jones was born in \"1954\" and died aged \"46\", Alisa Jones was born in \"1956\" and died aged \"44\", and Phillip Jones was born in \"1990\" and died aged \"10\" (which was his age at death given in <i>[[AKA WWJD?]]</i> as well).<br>Throughout Season 2, the car crash is referred to many times as being \"17 years\" ago, placing this firmly in 2017. 3 dates appear in the season, contradictory to each other (there is no possible way to make any of them fit together) - a \"5/5/2017\" date in <i>AKA Sole Survivor</i>, a \"Thursday, June 1\" date in <i>[[AKA The Octopus]]</i>, and a \"Wednesday, July 5\" date in <i>[[AKA Facetime]]</i>.<br>The \"Wednesday, July 5\" does not work because it is explicitly the day after a \"Sunday\", and neither the \"Thursday, June 1\" nor \"Wednesday, July 5\" dates work since Nichelle tells Malcolm in <i>AKA Facetime</i> that it is \"3 more months till [her] master's\". A master's cannot be taken later than August, making this no later than May.<br>The \"5/5/2017\" date, however, lines up with the evidence:*The scene with Nichelle, a little later in the month, would work as being 3 months until Nichelle's master's in August.*It is just over 3 days since the Empire State Building was shown lit up green - the building was lit up green on the night of May 1st for mental health awareness, and this is now the night of May 4th-5th (early hours of the 5th).*It is a Thursday-Friday night, matching with it being a \"school night\" and the next morning being a Trish Talk day, with Trish Talk being a \"weekday\" show.*It works with the weather, starting colder but, by Episode 4 - <i>[[AKA God Help the Hobo]]</i>, becoming hot.*<a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/jessica-jones-season-2-timeline-order-how-long-defenders-835820\">Melissa Rosenberg stated that the season picks up 6 months to a year after <i>Marvel's The Defenders</i>: Season 1</a>, and April 2017 is 11 months after the season.So, the season firmly begins in April 2017, with the majority set in May 2017, and the \"5/5/2017\" date matching the evidence nicely.<br>This means that the main events of the season, from Trish Walker talking to Ian up to Alisa Jones' death, transpire from April 28, 2017 to May 30, 2017."

The next scene then shows him doing push-ups. This is followed by a scene where he scrunches up a piece of work, followed by another push-up scene. He then gets angry about a free kick, and then there is a final push-up scene, before the scene with his 49th monkey face, on June 30th. Last time the monkeys were shown, they were in rows of 4 (incomplete row), 7 | (line on the wall) 7, 7, 3 (incomplete row). In all 3 push-up scenes, it now appears that the 4th row above the line on the wall is 6 (incomplete row). This would suggest that it is 6, 7, 7, 7 | 7, 7, 3-7. It is unknown whether Fitz has added to that bottom row we previously saw incomplete or just left it as an incomplete row of 3. The scene after, with the 49th monkey face, shows that the bottom row has indeed been filled out, so he must have filled it at some point over this time. By distribution, we can approximate that ((1 - 0.5) ÷ 3) × 4 = roughly 1 of the missing 4 has been filled out in the 1st scene, ((2 - 0.5) ÷ 3) × 4 = 2 have been filled out in the 2nd, and ((3 - 0.5) ÷ 3) × 4 = roughly 3 in the 3rd scene. This would mean there is approximately a total of 45, 46, and 47 monkeys respectively in the 3 push-up scenes, thus making them approximately June 26th, 27th, and 28th.<br>There are very few soccer games on in late June, so it is hard to believe that there were games on consecutive days. Therefore, the game playing in the scene before the push-ups on the 27th and the game playing in the scene after the push-ups on the 27th has to be assumed to be the same game, with Fitz muting or turning it off in the middle for push-ups. Therefore, these scenes are either side of the push-ups on the 27th. There isn't an obvious match that it could be which he is watching, but it can be assumed that the soccer schedule between seasons in the <i>MCU</i> is not identical to the real world."

Questioning a lot of... the point of it all.\" This would imply merely 2 months since he woke, \"weeks\" after the main events of <i>[[The Defenders (episode)|The Defenders]]</i>, but this is impossible. It can either be taken that Murdock is using \"couple\" the informal way to mean \"few\", or just that only in the last couple of months of his hiding has he started questioning things, though this would not have been long after he recovered. So, either way, this still implies not long since <i>The Defenders</i>. Then, in <i>[[The Perfect Game]]</i>, Karen Page is asked, \"When's the last time you heard from Matt Murdock?\", and replies, \"Um... months,\" though it can be taken that she is trying to downplay the length of time, without actually lying. It is also generally strongly implied that not much time passes following <i>The Defenders</i> before the main events of the season. In <i>[[Reunion (Daredevil)|Reunion]]</i>, it is said that Fisk was wrongly convicted \"2 years\" ago, and in <i>[[One Last Shot]]</i> it is said that Vanessa Marianna was protected for \"2 years\". With Fitz's arrest and Marianna going into hiding both being February 2015 (see [[2015]] references), this would suggest it is now early 2017. It is also clearly around winter-time, so it would seem on this evidence alone that it is early 2017, about 8 months after <i>The Defenders</i>: Season 1.<br>However, these are not mutually compatible, as the main events of <i>Iron Fist</i>: Season 2 take place before the main events of <i>Daredevil</i>: Season 3, with references in <i>[[This Deadly Secret]]</i> and <i>[[Citadel on the Edge of Vengeance]]</i> to Danny Rand carrying out Matt Murdock's mission (given to him in <i>The Defenders</i> when Murdock thought he was going to die and wanted Rand to fight in his place), implying Murdock is still thought deceased. The official synopsis for <i>Iron Fist</i>: Season 2 says, <a href=\"https://www.comicbookmovie.com/tv/marvel/iron_fist/iron-fist-season-2-synopsis-reveals-that-danny-rand-is-stepping-up-to-take-daredevils-place-a162297\">\"This season, Danny has promised that with Matt Murdock gone, he will step up and protect his city,\"</a> confirming Murdock is still thought dead. All of <i>Iron Fist</i>: Season 2, except for its epilogue, should therefore take place before the reappearance of \"Daredevil\" during the attack on the New York Bulletin Building in <i>[[The Devil You Know]]</i>, followed shortly by Murdock's public reappearance. Some compromise has to be made wherein <i>Daredevil</i>: Season 3 is later than early 2017, and <i>Iron Fist</i>: Season 2 is earlier than early 2018.<br><i>Iron Fist</i>: Season 2 can be dragged earlier, but at the absolute earliest it is late 2017, with the spring fair committee taken to be planning far ahead of time - a few months. This is a stretch, but again, necessary to make it work. And there are a few things that work better with <i>Iron Fist</i>: Season 2 being late 2017: in <i>The Fury of Iron Fist</i>, Rand says he \"missed the last 15 years of culture\", having been missing for almost 15 years and now catching up, and while not particularly including the time since he returned, it nonetheless implies it is still close to 15 years since he went missing, and 2017 is 16 years rather than 2018 being 17; in <i>The Fury of Iron Fist</i> and <i>This Deadly Secret</i>, it is said that it is \"months\" since Joy and Ward Meachum last spoke, which is implied to be referring if not to [[Iron Fist (TV series)/Season One|Season 1]] then to a time shortly after then, so the shorter the span between Season 1 and 2 the better; Misty Knight is still considering the captain offer, has taken leave to ponder it, and is implied to have not seen Luke Cage since <i>[[They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.)]]</i>, which works much better as a month or so after the end of <i>Luke Cage</i>: Season 2 in September 2017 than a few months later; in <i>[[Morning of the Mindstorm]]</i> it is said that Rand has been \"all over Chinatown for months\", which is implied to be referring if not to <i>The Defenders</i>: Season 1 then to a time shortly after then, so the shorter the span between then and this season the better; the epilogue of <i>A Duel of Iron</i> \"months later\" fits more comfortably before <i>[[Avengers: Infinity War]]</i> in May 2018 if <i>A Duel of Iron</i> is late 2017 than early 2018, and it should be before <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MRavenMetzner/status/1040696708131254272\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UqrlizXWIM&t=2015s\">2</a>).<br><i>Daredevil</i>: Season 3 can be pushed to late 2017, at the latest. This causes problems in relation to <i>The Defenders</i>: Season 1, as it makes it roughly 17 months since then, when it is implied to be only a few months. It somewhat works as \"months\", being only over a year, not yet a year-and-a-half or 2 years, but it is a big stretch. You certainly cannot push it further, as this is the latest it can be while still being considered \"2 years\" since early 2015, as well as the absolute most you can stretch the gap since <i>The Defenders</i>: Season 1. But some evidence does in fact support late 2017: this works better with the line in <i>The Perfect Game</i> from Benjamin Donovan, \"an early and very white Christmas\"; the season has to be after <i>Luke Cage</i>: Season 2 (finishing September 2017) as, not only is it after <i>Iron Fist</i>: Season 2 which is after <i>Luke Cage</i>; Season 2, but Karen Page is referenced in <i>[[The Creator]]</i> as still working as a reporter, when she loses that job and begins working for Nelson, Murdock and Page in <i>Daredevil</i>: Season 3; most importantly, the DA election occurred in New York City in the real world in late 2017.<br>With <i>Daredevil</i>: Season 3 pushed forward to its absolute limit and <i>Iron Fist</i>: Season 2 pulled back to its absolute limit, they can just about be pulled to meet at late 2017.<br>There is some evidence for it being very late 2017: heavy snow is shown during <i>Daredevil</i>: Season 3, which works significantly better are November-December than October-November, and the later in 2017, the better for <i>Iron Fist</i>: Season 2 as it is closer to early 2018. However, the majority of the evidence, with a late 2017 placement, would point to October-November 2017: in <i>[[Aftermath]]</i>, is it shown to be 57°F at 18:30 in New York City, which would suggest ideally approximately late October (or mid-to-late April); <i>Iron Fist</i>: Season 2 is seemingly not long after Knight's job offer in <i>Luke Cage</i>: Season 2, with Knight still considering the captain job offer; it is slightly closer to <i>The Defenders</i>: Season 1 (17 months rather than 18/19 - keeping it under a year-and-a-half), so just slightly more plausible for the mentions of \"months\"; it is also slightly closer to <i>Iron Fist</i>: Season 1, again fitting slightly better with the implications of \"months\"; it is slightly more plausible as \"2 years\" since early 2015; it makes it under 16 years since Danny Rand's plane crash when he says he missed \"the last 15 years of culture\"; most importantly, it fits with the real New York City DA election - it would be odd to align with late 2017 but not quite line up with a big timeline indicator (especially since <i>They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.)</i> establishes at least some election dates as the same in the <i>MCU</i>), and the election's inclusion can be taken as an indication that it was not meant to be right at the end of the year, despite the snow. So, the two seasons should be in the lead-up to the November 7, 2017 election, as late as possible.<br>The final scenes of <i>Daredevil</i>: Season 3, still before the election, are a Friday (working forward from Poindexter saying in <i>No Good Deed</i> that it is Tuesday). As late as possible makes it Friday, November 3, 2017. Working back, this puts the attack on the <i>New York Bulletin</i> building on October 27, 2017.<br>The seasons should overlap as much as possible, to allow <i>Iron Fist</i>: Season 2 to be as late (close to its ideal early 2018) as possible. So, Rand leaving in the plane should be as late as possible while still before the attack on the <i>New York Bulletin</i>. The day of Rand leaving is a Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday, based on dialogue in the season. Taking it to be Friday (the exact same day as the attack on the <i>New York Bulletin</i>), however, also allows the ambush on Fisk's convoy to fall comfortably in the gap between <i>Morning of the Mindstorm</i> and <i>Citadel on the Edge of Vengeance</i> in <i>Iron Fist</i>: Season 2, thus meaning that this major event, worthy of citywide news, not being addressed during <i>Iron Fist</i>: Season 2 is not a problem. So, the end of the main events of <i>Iron Fist</i>: Season 2 can be taken to be Friday, October 27, 2017.<br>Working back from there, <i>Iron Fist</i>: Season 2 spans 18 days at an absolute minimum, meaning the latest it can start is Monday, October 9, 2017. However, in <i>The Fury of Iron Fist</i>, Rand jokes that their date nights should become a regular occurrence, \"every Tuesday\", implying it is currently Tuesday. The latest Tuesday it can be, therefore, is Tuesday, October 3, 2017, with the season spanning 24 days (other than the epilogue). This is a more suitable length, considering the battle at Golden Tigers' Hideout is referred to in <i>Morning of the Mindstorm</i> as \"a few weeks ago\" (this pushes it to 2 weeks prior) as well as Rand's recovery from injury - said to be incredibly fast, but still spanning some time - now taking 15 days, while taking into consideration that it is not possible to stretch the season a further week, to start on September 26, 2017, since the passage of time in the season does not fit with much more than the approximate 24 days.<br>Finally, when aligned side-by-side, this gives:*October 3-20, 2017: <i>The Fury of Iron Fist</i>-<i>Morning of the Mindstorm</i>.*October 22-23, 2017: <i>Resurrection</i> ending-<i>No Good Deed</i> opening.*October 24, 2017: <i>Citadel on the Edge of Vengeance</i> opening/<i>No Good Deed</i>.*October 25, 2017: <i>Citadel on the Edge of Vengeance</i>-<i>War Without End</i> opening/<i>[[Blindsided]]</i>.*October 26, 2017: <i>War Without End</i>-<i>A Duel of Iron</i> opening/<i>The Perfect Game</i>.*October 27, 2017: <i>A Duel of Iron</i>/<i>The Devil You Know</i>-<i>Aftermath</i> opening.*October 28-November 3, 2017: <i>Aftermath</i>-<i>[[A New Napkin]]</i>."

In <i>[[Thor: Ragnarok]]</i>, Thor says, \"Sokovia, Ultron, that was 2 years ago.\" Banner asks, \"I've been Hulk for 2 years?\", and he replies, \"I'm afraid so.\" Then, later, Banner mentions (from Thor's information) that he was \"trapped for 2 years inside of a monster.\" These refer to it being 2 years since the Battle of Sokovia, dated to May 6, 2015.

Overall, the maths weighing up this evidence places the film around July 2017, a little over 2 years after <i>Avengers: Age of Ultron</i>, nearly 4 years after <i>Thor: The Dark World</i>.<br>However, <i>[[Avengers: Infinity War]]</i> places itself firmly in March 2018, by all the evidence given for its placement by the film itself and <i>[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]</i>. This would suggest around 8 months between the films, but the films seem very much to take place only a few months apart, due to implications from the dialogue in the <i>Thor: Ragnarok</i> credits scene, the identical state of the Asgardians, and the fact the characters are physically no different (hair, beards, outfits, etc.). Overall, the math places <i>Thor: Ragnarok</i> as occurring around mid-to-late November 2017, 4 months before <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i>.

    "desc": "In <i>[[Reunion (Runaways)|Reunion]]</i>, it is shown that the last time Amy logged in to play <i>Star Wars: Battlefront</i> was \"2 years ago\". With <i>PlayStation</i> time stamps rounding down, this means it has been anywhere between 2.00 and 2.99 years. With the game released on November 16, 2015, this means that at the very earliest, it is now late November 2017. In <i>[[Fifteen]]</i>, it is shown that in Geoffrey Wilder's drawer, he has what appears to be a newly bought 2018 planner. It does not look used, and is being kept in a drawer of miscellaneous items - the drawer being mainly intended for accessing his secret gun, not for important items. It can be taken, therefore, that it is roughly late 2017, but perhaps 2018. In <i>[[Refraction]]</i>, in a flashback to \"25 years ago\", students are shown saying \"Dude, have you seen <i>Reservoir Dogs</i> yet?\" \"Oh, my God, it was so good.\" The implication of this is that the film has just come out, which was in October 1992, suggesting that present day is late 2017. Chase also says in <i>[[Rewind (Runaways)|Rewind]]</i> that \"in another year [he'll] be off to college\", suggesting that it is late in the year, around the time college starts/a year before next year's college starts, and in <i>Refraction</i>, they say that they will have \"a hell of a personal essay for [their] college applications,\" implying that the applications are not yet finished, so it is not as late as January yet. In <i>Rewind</i>, Frank looks at Leslie's laptop calendar, and it says that the date is Friday 8th. It also shows that the month before was 31 days long and that this month is also 31 days long. While this would make it August (which it cannot be, since August is not during school term) or January, after January 2016, which is far too early, the next time that all 3 criteria are satisfied is January 2021, which is far too late. The calendar is not a reliable source, however, as it shows that the month ends with \"26, 27, 28, 29, 29, 30, 31\" and the next month begins with \"1, 2, 3, 4, 29\". However, after July 2016, which is too early, the months that have Friday 8ths are September 2017, December 2017, June 2018, and February 2019. In <i>[[Doomsday]]</i>, it is then shown that Atlas Academy is hosting the \"non-holiday-specific seasonal dance\", which implies it is December.<br>Ultimately, it can be taken that <i>[[Runaways (TV series)|Runaways]]</i>: Season 1 occurs in December 2017. This is 25 years since late 1992, 2 years and a few days since Amy last played <i>Star Wars: Battlefront</i> on her day of death in early December 2015 (a couple of weeks after the game was released), about the time when Geoffrey would have bought a 2018 planner but not have used it yet, just under a year until college, a bit before college application deadlines, a month where there is indeed a Friday 8th, the time when a \"non-holiday-specific seasonal dance\" would be held, and also the real time date at the middle of the season's run (from November 2017 to January 2018).<br><i>Runaways</i>: Season 1 therefore begins on Friday, December 8, 2017, with the events of <i>[[Destiny]]</i> on Saturday, December 9th, <i>Fifteen</i> beginning that night and then going to Monday, December 11th, when <i>[[Kingdom]]</i> also takes place. At the end of <i>Kingdom</i>, Leslie says that the gala is in a few days, and <i>[[Metamorphosis]]</i> appears to be at the weekend, but when <i>Metamorphosis</i> picks up, characters act like it has been only a day or two, so it is as soon as possible after: Saturday, December 16th. <i>Refraction</i> and <i>[[Tsunami]]</i> are as soon as possible after again, and are confirmed by <i>Doomsday</i> to be on Thursday: Thursday, December 21st, with <i>Doomsday</i> the next day on Friday (the signs say \"Friday 7-11 PM\"), December 22nd, the last day of term, and finally <i>[[Hostile]]</i> taking the season to the morning of Sunday, December 24th. Victor says in <i>Refraction</i>, \"On Monday, you are gonna make a public apology to my son and reinstate him to the lacrosse team,\" implying that it should be the week before, as the Monday after December 18th is December 25th, when there is no school. This is overruled, however, by Jonah saying in <i>Doomsday</i>, \"[Your children have] been lying to you for weeks,\" and, \"They've been conspiring against you for weeks,\" and Alex saying in the same episode, \"Look, I know that it's been a shitty couple of weeks.\" This means it is at least 2 weeks after Friday 8th, so the earliest it can be is Friday 22nd rather than Friday 15th."

This is evident because the events of the rest of the episode take place on a school day, so it cannot simply be the next day, despite that being the implication. It has to be at least Monday. This is supported by the fact that when Chase Stein encounters his lacrosse teammates for the first time since the party, they say, \"All weekend, no apology?\" This heavily suggests it is Monday, with it being their first encounter since Friday and it being just after \"all weekend\". Frank Dean also says to Leslie, \"I haven't seen you in days.\" The last time he saw her was Friday, so this works well as Monday, 3 days later, and matches with what Leslie says, \"That's what I've been doing in there, praying for you over the last 2 days.\" She is claiming to have been praying since Saturday."

In <i>[[One Bad Day]]</i>, it is shown that events following the duel at the Central Park carousel in <i>[[Memento Mori]]</i>, dated to December 13, 2016, are \"one year ago\" (with Madani also saying this in the episode), suggesting late 2017, or, if the flashback scene is early January 2017, then early 2018. Then, during the robbery scene, a calendar is shown with days/dates and holidays aligning exactly with May 2018 (also fitting <i>Restless</i>). It is stated to be Friday, making it Friday 4th, 11th, 18th, or 25th, with the flashback presumably early January 2017. The current boxes and files employees are shown to be using are also shown to say \"2018\", further affirming the year. In <i>[[My Brother's Keeper]]</i>, a banner is up for an event on \"APRIL 18-20\", but can be assumed to have just been left up afterward. In <i>[[Flustercluck]]</i>, 2 days later, a phone calendar is shown saying it is the 13th, placing the robbery on Friday, May 11, 2018. <i>[[The Abyss]]</i> contains confirmation that it is after the events of <i>[[A New Napkin]]</i>, dated to November 2017 (see [[2017]] references). It also shows an ID valid \"01/18\"-\"01/20\", again further affirming that it is 2018, not 2017. It is also still sunny after 19:19, so between approximately March 18th and September 14th, fitting with the May setting. Brett Mahoney also says it is Tuesday, 2 days after the phone indicated it was the 13th, fitting with it being Tuesday, May 15, 2018. So, the season's main events can be placed from April 28 (27 including the flashbacks comprising the majority of <i>[[Roadhouse Blues]]</i>), 2018 to May 17, 2018.<br>Jeph Loeb stated that all Marvel Television released between April 2018 and April 2019 is set before the Snap of <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> (<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/8pbxyk/im_jeph_loeb_head_of_marvel_tv_ama/e0a5ju5/\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UqrlizXWIM&t=2015s\">2</a>). The placement of <i>The Punisher</i>: Season 2 does end up contributing to the Snap being as late as its May 31, 2018 placement (see other references), but, simultaneously, an approximate May 31, 2018 placement for the Snap is suggested regardless, so the main events of <i>The Punisher</i>: Season 2 finishing by May 17, 2018 fit accordingly. The only issue is the \"three months later\" epilogue scene of <i>The Whirlwind</i>, which would occur in August 2018, after the Snap. However, this is not enough to contradict the clear April-May 2018 placement of the main events (nor push the Snap to August, with plenty of evidence placing it in the first half of 2018 - see other references). It must be assumed that Frank Castle and Dinah Madani survived the Snap. The scene itself provides no contradiction to the event of the Snap, and can comfortably be set after."

The Wednesday of <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> is still during school time, as Peter Parker is on a school field trip. <i>[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]</i> establishes that Parker restarted <a href=\"http://www.slashfilm.com/spider-man-homecoming-2-avengers-4/\">junior year</a> after returning in the Blip, making him a junior at the time of the Snap. With Parker beginning sophomore year in <i>[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]</i> in September 2016, he would finish junior year in June 2018. This means that the Wednesday of <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> should be before Tuesday, June 26, 2018, when New York high schools finished for summer (<a href=\"http://schools.nyc.gov/Calendar/default.htm\">1</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hsas-lehman.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Calendar17-18.pdf\">2</a>, <a href=\"http://hsmse.org/about-us/school-calendar/\">3</a>). If necessary, it can be assumed that either Parker's school finished 1 day later than most, or the New York high schools in the <i>MCU</i> finished 1 day later than those in the real world, making Wednesday, June 27, 2018 the absolute latest that <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> could begin.<br>The earliest possible date is January 2018, as all these events must take place in 2018.

It is further confirmed that <i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i> takes place in \"2014\" on-screen. In these scenes, Ebony Maw says Nebula is from \"9 years\" in the future, making it 2023.*<i>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</i>: Season 5, Episodes 14-22 take place in 2018.**In Episode 8 - <i>[[The Last Day]]</i>, a flashforward is shown with events that, as shown in Episode 22 - <i>The End</i>, would take place on the Thursday of <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i>, and the on-screen text specifically says \"2018\".**The agents return to the present day in Episode 11 - <i>[[All the Comforts of Home]]</i>. Later that day, Yo-Yo Rodriguez has her arms sliced off. The agents perform surgery on her amputated arms, and she begins to heal. 2 days later, in Episode 12 - <i>[[The Real Deal]]</i>, the monitor by her bed shows \"12-06-2017\", making it December 6, 2017 (see [[2017]] references for reasons this is a firm placement). By Episode 14 - <i>The Devil Complex</i>, the skin on Rodriguez's arm stumps has healed over, which takes 4 weeks to 2 months (<a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/definition-amputation#2-5\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sharecare.com/health/amputation-physical-disability/take-to-recover-from-amputation\">2</a>). With Rodriguez having lost her arms and had surgery performed on them on December 4, 2017, earliest that <i>The Devil Complex</i> can take place is January 2018, thus meaning that from Episode 14 onward, it is 2018.**In Episode 15 - <i>Rise and Shine</i>, events set at the time of [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D./Season Three|Season 3]], Episode 17 - <i>[[The Team]]</i> and Episode 18 - <i>[[The Singularity]]</i> in April 2016 are shown on-screen to have been \"2 years ago\".**In Episode 16 - <i>Inside Voices</i>, events set immediately after [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D./Season One|Season 1]], Episode 22 - <i>[[Beginning of the End]]</i> in January 2014 are shown on-screen to have been \"four years ago\".So, all of these events take place in the first half of 2018. However, there is contradictory evidence for when exactly in the first 6 months of the year. <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i>, <i>Ant-Man and the Wasp</i>, <i>The Punisher</i>, and <i>Jessica Jones</i> would suggest closer to June 2018, while <i>Thor: Ragnarok</i>, <i>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</i>, and <i>Spider-Man: Far From Home</i> would suggest closer to January 2018.<br>Scott Lang's 2-year house arrest coming to an end would imply that it has been 24 months since the end of the main events of <i>Captain America: Civil War</i>. In that film, Lang is arrested on June 24, 2016 (a firmly established date - see [[2016]] references). Steve Rogers breaks him out of the Raft 2 days later, on June 26, 2016, and very soon after (as shown in <i>[[Avengers: Infinity War Prelude]]</i>), Lang returns home after making his deal. The exact date that the sentence would end depends on a few factors, such as when the sentence counts as beginning from, if it counts from his initial imprisonment then whether each day spent in prison counts as double towards his sentence, and if time could be/was removed. At the earliest, the house arrest would finish on June 20, 2018. At the latest, June 27, 2018. The arrest finishes on a Wednesday, and at the very shortest, the events of <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> start 1 week later (as at least one more weekend is shown to occur before the end of the film) on the following Wednesday. The very last day that the events of <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> can possibly begin is Wednesday, June 27, 2018, so the latest Lang's house arrest could end would also be the earliest: Wednesday, June 20, 2018. This would also line up well with the references to the time between previous films and <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i>, with them placing it ideally closer to mid-2018 than early.<br>However, there are several things in <i>Thor: Ragnarok</i>, <i>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</i>, and <i>Spider-Man: Far From Home</i> suggesting it is much earlier in the year.*Firstly, <i>Thor: Ragnarok</i> is firmly set in 2017 (see [[2017]] references). At the very latest, it takes place in November-December 2017, before <i>All the Comforts of Home</i> on December 4, 2017, which features a reference to the events of the film. There is a jump in time between the end of the main events of the film and the film's mid-credits scene, which is set mere minutes before the opening of <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i>. However, the gap should be minimal, for several reasons:**The film finishes with Thor deciding to head back to Earth. Only in the mid-credits scene do he and Loki seem to actually begin discussing the problems with bringing Loki back to the planet. This would imply that it is very soon after the decision was made.**Thor's hair is exactly the same in <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> as it is in <i>Thor: Ragnarok</i>, including the streak on the side from the Watcher Informant's poor cutting. While it's possible that Asgardian hair grows slower than humans', it nonetheless implies very little time has passed.**The <i>Statesman</i> has a few hundred Asgardians on board that need food and water and other general living standards, and the ship itself is highly unlikely to have enough on board to sustain a few hundred people for very long. It is possible that they could have gone a little longer if one assumes they stopped at other places for resources on the way and/or that Asgardians need less sustenance than humans, but nonetheless, the longer the gap, the more and more assumptions have to me made.*<i>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</i>: Episode 12 - <i>The Real Deal</i> is firmly set on December 6, 2017, as given by the \"12-06-2017\" date on Rodriguez's monitor, and which lines up with all the other evidence as mentioned above. Episode 13 - <i>Principia</i> takes place shortly after and, as is evidenced by the \"12-17-2017\" date and Coulson's mention of \"tidings of comfort of joy\", it is Christmas. When Episode 14 - <i>The Devil Complex</i> begins, it is heavily implied to be merely another several days later:**In Episode 12 - <i>The Real Deal</i>, the team discover that Coulson is dying. For them, it has been only a few days since Coulson made the deal with Ghost Rider, yet it has become quite bad. They do not know when he will die, but considering it took just a few days to get this bad, it would be strange for it to take several further months to kill him.**In Episode 13 - <i>Principia</i>, Fitz says in December 2017, \"The, uh, the gravitonium device that we used to seal the rift is barely strong enough. It's duct tape on the Hoover Dam. It's not gonna hold.\" Coulson asks, \"How much time before the dam starts leaking?\", and he says, \"Well, uh, it's hard to calculate that precisely, but, based on the increased frequency of transit, electromagnetic waves, I'd say that our days were numbered.\" While he clearly does not know exactly how long they have, the implication is absolutely no more than a couple of weeks.**In Episode 14 - <i>The Devil Complex</i>, Simmons says she would like to have a honeymoon with Fitz, implying they recently married. In Episode 17 - <i>The Honeymoon</i>, Simmons jokes about this being their honeymoon, implying they recently got married.**In Episode 14 - <i>The Devil Complex</i>, Mackenzie is testing Rodriguez's newly made robotic arms. They got the arms from Hale's mechs in <i>Principia</i>. Considering how fast they usually work, it really should not take them very long to make the arms.**In Episode 14 - <i>The Devil Complex</i>, Mackenzie says to Rodriguez, \"Your arms aren't fully healed yet. What you need is time.\" Rodriguez replies, \"My arms may not work, but my eyes do. At least let me sit in Control, keep an eye out for anomalies.\" Mackenzie says, \"Maybe, but you have to allow yourself to heal. We'll handle the fighting for now.\" As well as this, Rodriguez is still in her hospital-esque bed for a lot of the episode. This implies that she is still healing and still needs to be taken care of, which should not be for more than a couple of months absolute maximum.**In Episode 14 - <i>The Devil Complex</i>, Deke Shaw is still a bit dazed about having worked out that Fitz and Simmons are his grandparents.**In Episode 14 - <i>The Devil Complex</i>, Fitz says, \"Well, I've temporarily plugged the dam, but it could burst at any minute, releasing more of these anomalies into the base.\" The phrasing implies the temporary plugging was recent.*In Episode 14 - <i>The Devil Complex</i>, snow is shown on the ground, suggesting it is still winter.*In Episode 15 - <i>Rise and Shine</i>, Coulson says to Hale, \"Listen, my team wasn't hiding all these months. We traveled to the future.\" From this, it can be taken that it has only been \"months\" since May 12, 2017, when the agents were sent to the future. While it has to now be 2018, it should not be later than early 2018. As well as this, this piece of dialogue suggests that the amount of time that his team have been back in the present is negligible, because he is generalizing the whole time since May 12, 2017 as the time that they were not around, but in the future.*In <i>[[Missing Pieces]]</i>, Enoch says he was going to protect Fitz for the next \"73 years, 261 days\". The team are in 2091, so if they left the future as early as possible, December 31, 2091, then since Fitz wakes 4 days prior, the latest he can possibly have woken is December 27, 2091. Even if Fitz were to wake as late as possible, the latest this scene could be is then April 10, 2018. Except the scene is implied to after <i>The End</i>, since it should be after the split in the timeline (seemingly not possible to have happened in the original timeline), suggesting <i>The End</i> should be no later than April 10, 2018.*In <i>[[Fear and Loathing on the Planet of Kitson]]</i>, Enoch says he is planning to orbit Jupiter with Fitz for the next \"72 years, 312 days\", which should end before he takes Fitz to the Lighthouse. Fitz wakes no later than December 27, 2091, so the latest <i>Fear and Loathing on the Planet of Kitson</i> could possibly be is February 18, 2019. However, it is 13 months on from <i>The End</i> (Coulson and May \"got more [time] than [they] thought [they] would\", so Coulson lived roughly the \"weeks\" Simmons mentions he might have if he is lucky in <i>The End</i>, and <i>Missing Pieces</i> ends on the 1-year anniversary of Coulson's death, the same day <i>Fear and Loathing on the Planet of Kitson</i> is set - plus it is mentioned that Fitz died \"over a year ago\"), so <i>The End</i> would have to finish in January 2018.*In <i>Spider-Man: Far From Home</i>, Betty Brant says, \"Even though we had blipped away halfway through the school year and had already taken midterms.\" This would make it approximately January/February. There is wiggle room for it to loosely mean \"halfway\", just \"in the bulk of\", \"not at the beginning or end of\", but it should still be no later than May 2018, so it is not in the final several weeks of term. This essentially confirms that Lang did not serve a full 24 months, as <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> cannot be as late as June 2018 following this comment.Furthermore, <i>[[The Punisher]]</i>: [[The Punisher/Season Two|Season 2]], which firmly places itself in April-May 2018 (see other references). Jeph Loeb stated in July 2018, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UqrlizXWIM&t=2015s\">\"The short answer is that the stories that you're seeing, unless otherwise noted, all happen before [...] what is affectionately referred to as \"The Thanos Snap\". And we'll continue to be in that place until we find out what happens in <i>Avengers 4</i>,\"</a> referring to all <i>Marvel Cinematic Universe</i> television released before April 26, 2019. This would place <i>The Punisher</i>: Season 2 (released in January 2019) before <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> (save for the \"three months later\" epilogue of <i>The Whirlwind</i>, which is August 2018, so has to be after <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> no matter what), thereby making <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> set in at least May 2018. However, this is also the only answer Loeb could feasibly give, and he does not explicitly cover every single season, nor specifically <i>The Punisher</i>: Season 2 (saying only that the shows will be set before <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/8pbxyk/im_jeph_loeb_head_of_marvel_tv_ama/e0a5ju5/\">\"for the most part\"</a> on a prior occasion), so it is possible that the one season being set after <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> is not a hard contradiction to Loeb's comments, but April 2018 would be no more than 3 months maximum after Thanos snaps his fingers, and to see no acknowledgement of this in the world so shortly after is highly unlikely. Placing the Snap in May 2018, all pushing and pulling factors considered, makes sense as a compromise anyway, so the Snap should indeed be placed after the main events of <i>The Punisher</i>: Season 2. Thursday, May 17, 2018 would make the most sense (mere hours after the end of the main events), as it is as early as possible, to be as far away as possible from the end of school term in conjunction with the \"halfway\" <i>Spider-Man: Far From Home</i> line.<br>A final complication comes from <i>[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]</i>: [[Jessica Jones (TV series)/Season Three|Season 3]]. Most evidence would place it in November-December 2018, but this would be just about 6 months post-Snap, with zero acknowledgement of such a monumental, worldwide long-lasting trauma effect. Ultimately, the best-fitting placement is April-May 2018 instead (see other references), allowing it to be pre-Snap. However, in that case, the season ends on May 27, 2018, making the earliest the Snap can be Thursday, May 31, 2018. So, using this earliest possible placement (as any later would contradict <i>Spider-Man: Far From Home</i>, and late May is already much closer to the later evidence than the earlier), <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> and its related events can be placed on May 30-31, 2018, with the main events of <i>The Devil Complex</i> to <i>All Roads Lead...</i> therefore being May 17-21, 2018.<br>A laptop early in <i>Ant-Man and the Wasp</i> has the date <a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/caps.pictures/201/7-antman-wasp/full/antman-wasp-movie-screencaps.com-1217.jpg?strip=all\">\"4/30/2018\"</a>. With the idea of Lang's house arrest being 24 months thrown out, so <i>Ant-Man and the Wasp</i>'s placement flexible - and the events of <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> being mid-to-late May 2018, late April-early May 2018 for the main events of <i>Ant-Man and the Wasp</i> would make sense. The main events of <i>Ant-Man and the Wasp</i> begin on a Sunday, with Cassie saying, \"I had a fun weekend.\" Scott has 3 days remaining of his house arrest sentence, and the sentence finishes right after the climax, making that Wednesday. Working back, Scott's dream in the bath is Monday night, meaning the house arrest montage spans Sunday and Monday. April 30, 2018 is a Monday, so this aligns for the main events to be Sunday, April 29, 2018 to Wednesday, May 2, 2018."

    "desc": "Deke Shaw is shot in the arm in Episode 17 - <i>[[The Honeymoon]]</i>, the day before the end of <i>[[All Roads Lead...]]</i>. Following this, he wears a sling until the beginning of Episode 21 - <i>[[The Force of Gravity]]</i>. This should mean that several weeks pass between him being shot and having the sling taken off. However, the only possible gap in time is between <i>All Roads Lead...</i> and <i>Option Two</i>, and the show treats it very much like it has been merely hours when <i>Option Two</i> begins. This would in total mean that Deke had the sling for barely over 1 day, which is impossible. Stretching the gap between <i>All Roads Lead...</i> and <i>Option Two</i>, it really can be no more than about 5 days, considering the agents' actions, discussions, and behavior. However, even if we consider that the surgery on Shaw was very successful and he healed very fast and took off the sling very prematurely - as soon as he could, to help him be more able in the times of crisis that were occurring, it really cannot be shorter than about 2 weeks of recovery time, which would involve a 13-day gap between <i>All Roads Lead...</i> and <i>Option Two</i>. Overall, a 9-day jump is necessary, giving 10 days of recovery time before taking off the sling. It absolutely cannot be any longer, yet it absolutely cannot be shorter. So, with <i>Option Two</i> being the Wednesday of <i>[[Avengers: Infinity War]]</i>, the main events of <i>All Roads Lead...</i> end on the previous week's Monday.<br>Working backwards, <i>All Roads Lead...</i> begins the day before (Sunday), and Episode 16 - <i>[[Inside Voices]]</i> and 17 - <i>The Honeymoon</i> are earlier that Sunday. In <i>Inside Voices</i>, Ruby Hale says, \"Why not talk to Coulson [...] I think after 2 days in isolation,\" which places the \"24 hours ago\" portion of Episode 15 - <i>[[Rise and Shine]]</i> as being 2 days prior, Friday, thus meaning that <i>Rise and Shine</i> spans the Thursday-Saturday almost 2 weeks before <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i>. The exact dates assigned to these days are May 17-21, 2018 (see other references)."

    "desc": "In <i>[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]</i>, a montage after Scott Lang is released from house arrest on May 2, 2018 (see other references) includes four scenes before the mid-credits scene set on May 31, 2018 (see other references). Firstly, Scott goes to Maggie Lang's house and hugs Cassie. While this can be interpreted as the first thing he does after release, he has changed clothes and asks Cassie \"You ready?\", implying he is picking her up. On Sunday, April 29, 2018, when Cassie says, \"I had a fun weekend, Daddy,\" Scott replies, \"Me too, Peanut. Just wait till next weekend.\" So, this should not be until the weekend after Scott's release, making it Saturday, May 5, 2018.<br>Following this is Luis securing the Karapetyan deal. With news from the San Francisco chase playing and the group being busy receiving calls, it appears to be shortly after May 2, 2018. While the trio missed their Karapetyan meeting on May 2nd, Karapetyan would presumably not wait too long to get in contact. Since Kurt is arranging a meeting for \"Monday\", this would suggest it is not currently Sunday or Monday. Tuesday, May 8, 2018 is too far from the main events of the film, so the other option, to be taken, is Saturday, May 5, 2018, hours after Scott picks up Cassie. He is in the same clothes. Presumably she is just not with him at that moment.<br>Hank Pym and Janet van Dyne then go to the beach, then Hope van Dyne sits with Scott and Cassie in a car to watch <i>Them!</i>. These can be distributed between May 5th and May 31st, making the <i>Them!</i> scene approximately May 22nd. However, this is not a weekend, and Scott seems to only have Cassie on weekends. The closest weekend day is May 20th. Then, placing the beach scene halfway between May 5th daytime and May 20th evening would put it around the morning of May 13th."

However, <i>The End</i> is set no earlier than May 2018 (see [[2018]] references), but the very latest Fitz can arrive for all the dystopian future events of [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D./Season Five|Season 5]] to be in 2091 is December 27, 2091, if the day they return from is December 31st. So, the very latest that the scene can take place, 73 years and 261 days prior, is April 10, 2018. The assumption has to be made that the ship was always attacked, just in the dystopian universe they managed to get back onto a ship without Fitz having to be unthawed, while post-change of events in May 2018, in the continuing universe, the difference is that they failed to get back on track and Fitz was unthawed. The closer the attack can be to the May 2018 change of time, the better.<br>In <i>[[Fear and Loathing on the Planet of Kitson]]</i>, when Enoch is asked where they are heading, he says, \"Naro-Atzia. And from there, back to our solar system so we can orbit Jupiter for another 72 years, 312 days, after we purchase a cryo-chamber.\" With the episode unable to be set any earlier than June 2019 (see [[2019]] references), this would suggest that Fitz does not wake until Spring 2092, which is impossible. The assumption has to be made that Enoch intended for the ship to keep orbiting Jupiter for a while after, if they need to return to it or for whatever other reason. Still, the closer the 2091 events can be to Spring 2092, the better, so very late 2091 works best for both [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D./Season Six|Season 6]] comments.<br>So, the latest possible dates in 2091 are being used: December 27-31, 2091."

While there are no obvious changes in the timeline until Melinda May and Leo Fitz save Alphonso Mackenzie and Polly Hinton, the change Robin Hinton senses in the episode is shown to be the fact that the Centipede Serum was slipped into Quake's gauntlets by Phil Coulson. This means that the timelines in fact diverge just before Coulson hands Quake her suit, and also fits with Robin Hinton's comment in <i>[[The Last Day]]</i> that Coulson would \"bring all the pieces together\", being his action that changes the timeline. For a short while after, events play out almost identically, with the only difference being that, without anyone except Coulson knowing, the serum is in fact in Quake's gauntlets. Coulson still does not, at least initially, take the serum in the original timeline as Quake was filmed in that timeline shouting at him in an identical manner to how she shouts at him in the new timeline for not taking it. The first sign of the timeline change, however, is Mackenzie and Hinton being saved, and then events begin to significantly diverge, being completely different once Quake finds the serum.<br>While we are shown very little of 2018 of the original timeline outside of <i>The Last Day</i>, we can assume that events are almost identical until Mackenzie and Hinton are saved. This includes the scenes in <i>[[Avengers: Infinity War]]</i> where Thanos talks to Gamora on the <i>Sanctuary II</i> and takes her to see Nebula, which occur concurrently with the events of <i>The End</i> between the divergence point and the beginning of actual significant signs of divergence.<br>The gaps in the original timeline can then be put together - the serum was left on Zephyr One, Mackenzie and Hinton died in the ship, Quake was absorbed by Talbot, Talbot destroyed the world, and finally what Yo-Yo Rodriguez alludes to in <i>[[Past Life]]</i> - as the world burned, May and Fitz got back to Zephyr One with Robin Hinton, but without Polly Hinton or Alphonso Mackenzie. They reached to grab them from the first of the surface to pull them on-board, but Mackenzie was not there. This is then followed by the \"2018\" scene of <i>The Last Day</i>.<br>There is also one thing we know from the original timeline that can be assumed for the new timeline, since events are occurring almost identically at the given point - that someone is filming when Quake leaves the Quinjet and shouts at Coulson (explained in <i>The Last Day</i>).<br>It is unclear what happened to Coulson in the original timeline. The serum is left on Zephyr One, but he does not appear to survive past 2018 anyway. Still, wherever events are unclear, they are excluded from the events descriptions."
