**[[File:Fme4.png|250px|thumb|May fighting Agent 33]]The month after the fire in the church, thanks to [[Skye]], Coulson and [[Melinda May]] manage to infiltrate the event to recover the painting with the aliens drawings. The [[HYDRA]] agents, [[Sunil Bakshi]] (disguised as [[Glenn Talbot]]), and [[Agent 33]] (disguised as Melinda May) attack Coulson, also looking for the painting.<ref name="AoS204"/><ref name="AoS2 Stretching">''[[Shadows]]'' has to occur in May-June 2014 ("one year ago" from May 2015, "entire winter" preceding it, see other references), but ''[[A Fractured House]]'' has to take place no earlier than March 2015 (see other references to the timespan between ''A Fractured House'' and ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''). There are undetermined spans of time between ''[[Heavy is the Head]]'' and ''[[Making Friends and Influencing People]]'', ''Making Friends and Influencing People'' and ''[[Face My Enemy]]'', and a mostly undetermined span between ''[[A Hen in the Wolf House]]'' and ''A Fractured House'', other than when ''A Fractured House'' picks up, it does not seem that Morse and Hunter have been reunited for long. A 3½-month span is placed between ''Heavy is the Head'' and ''Making Friends and Influencing People'', and ''Making Friends and Influencing People'' and ''Face My Enemy'', then a span of under 2 months between ''A Hen in the Wolf House'' and ''A Fractured House'', to stretch the first set of episodes to fill out the span of time reasonably.</ref><ref name="AoS2 May Talks at Party">In ''[[Face My Enemy]]'', Skye jokingly states that "[May] just said more words than I've heard her say in a year", implying that she has known May for over a year. The reasoned date for her saying this is January 9, 2015, and the reasoned date for her first meeting May is September 9, 2013, which works.</ref>
**May helps Coulson, and electrocutes Agent 33's face, causing damage to her [[Photostatic Veil]], rendering it permanently stuck to her face looking like May, with a burn mark.

*Skye is researching the Words, but is interrupted by [[Lance Hunter]], who tells her to consult [[Grant Ward]] on the subject. Ward desperately hopes that Skye was not carving the Words, as he tells her that [[John Garrett]] did it more and more after his infusion with [[GH.325]], as he became crazier and crazier. When Ward tells her that [[Raina]] was his source on information pertaining to [[Skye's Father]], Skye refuses to listen.<ref name="AoS205"/>

*Late at night, Farnum tries to choke Page to death, but she fights back and scratches his right eye. She then screams for help.<ref name="DD101"/>

Due to the necessary stretch between ''[[Heavy is the Head]]'' and ''[[A Fractured House]]'', him taking the Diviner to Whitehall has to be in January, approximately 10 weeks before he says this on March 29th.

Then everything changes; they all go start to go mad as he interrogates them, save one, Derik, who just wants to know when he can get out of there.

**Thompson escapes from his bindings, and some deep-rooted training helps him assist Coulson in breaking free as well. Thompson rushes his family to safety while Coulson momentarily neutralizes Derik and a difficult struggle ensues. Skye and [[Alphonso Mackenzie]] arrive, threatening to shoot Coulson, who has Derik trapped by the neck, believing that he is out of his mind. However, Coulson is not trying to kill him; he is trying to get him to look down at the massive toy train design Hank Thompson had constructed below them. From above, it looks like the alien writing; it looks like a three-dimensional city.

[[File:Hank-Thompson-Coulson-SHIELD.jpg|thumb|250px|Thompson talks to Coulson]]
*In the [[Playground]], Coulson tells Hank Thompson that they could use a super spy like him. Thompson refuses the offer, as he is happy being the family man he is now. He thanks Coulson for his second chance and gives him his business card. He has also now found his peace, and so has Coulson; the compulsion to carve is gone. Now all he has to do is figure out why the alien was so determined to get to that city.<ref name="AoS207"/><ref name="AoS2 Artifacts Few Months">In ''[[The Writing on the Wall]]'', Coulson says, "The writing's coming more and more frequently. Used to be two, three times a month. Then once a week. Now it's every day, every night." In ''[[Heavy is the Head]]'', it was overdue at 18 days – so approximately every 2 weeks, about twice a month. From that point, over the following months it would have progressed to 2 or 3 times a month, then once a week, then every day, up to this point – the implication from that is that it has been several months since ''Heavy is the Head''. As well as this, when addressing the agents, he says, "I know in the past few months, it may have seemed like I was leading you on some fool's errand, chasing after strange carvings and artifacts." Again, it has been months. The timeline works out as 9½ months.</ref>
*In her [[Trish Talk|radio program]], Walker holds the interview for Shlottman so that all the listeners can hear her experiences with Kilgrave. During the interview, [[Jeri Hogarth]] speaks as if Shlottman is insane, but Walker defends the girl, citing that in a world that has the [[Avengers]], the idea of a man with telepathy is not that far-fetched. Walker begins to insult Kilgrave, much to Jones' anxiety. When Walker takes callers' questions, [[Kilgrave]] himself calls in, questioning Walker's decision to taunt such a powerful man. Jones and Walker quickly exit the [[WNEX Station|radio station]] to go to Walker's apartment.<ref name="JJ103"/>

*Coulson vows that they will find Ward eventually. In the meantime, they will take advantage of his gift of Bakshi. Coulson addresses his team to assure them that he is not crazy.

**To stop him from attacking Walker, and seeing an opportunity to find Kilgrave, Jones injects Walker with a sedative, rendering her unconscious.

*In his new residence, [[Kilgrave]] orders Simpson to commit suicide by jumping from a balcony; Jones stops him but is discovered by Kilgrave. After knocking Simpson unconscious again so as to stop his repeated attempts at suicide, Jones pursues Kilgrave, but as he runs away, different residents in Kilgrave's apartment start to defend their master. Kilgrave escapes.<ref name="JJ103"/>
*Jones discovers a room covered wall-to-wall with pictures of her, and she sees a picture with writing stating simply: “see you later”.<ref name="JJ103"/>

*The team with Coulson ([[Leo Fitz]], [[Jemma Simmons]], [[Bobbi Morse]] and [[Alphonso Mackenzie]]) enter the [[Castillo San Cristóbal]], a garrison that was built above the hidden city, but their guide will not enter because of stories of it being haunted and that those who entered did not return.<ref name="AoS209"/><ref name="AoS2 Holidays">In ''[[...Ye Who Enter Here]]'', there are references to it being holiday time.

[[File:Raina-Skye2.png|thumb|250px|Raina tells [[Skye]] about the [[Inhumans]]]]
*On the [[Bus]], Raina tells Skye the stories that [[Raina's Grandmother|her grandmother]] told her of the [[Kree]] and their desire to destroy [[Humans|humanity]], except the chosen few selected by the Diviner. She lets her know that she is fond of [[Skye's Father]] because he found Raina in [[Thailand]] and sheltered her. Raina then debunks Skye's notion that she may be alien.<ref name="AoS209"/>
*During the conversation, Raina reveals that if the unworthy enter the temple, they would die. Before Skye can warn Coulson's team, four [[HYDRA]] [[Quinjet]]s surround the plane.<ref name="AoS209">''[[...Ye Who Enter Here|Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 2.09: ...Ye Who Enter Here]]''</ref>

Ward promises that HYDRA will not attack if Raina and Skye are relinquished to him; the two women leave with him.<ref name="AoS209"/>
*Elsewhere, [[Agent 33]] reports to [[Daniel Whitehall]] that Ward was successful in obtaining Raina, but that he has also captured Skye, and promised not to attack [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] in return.

She then turns and attacks a few nearby agents with the Diviner, turning them to stone, but is restrained. Whitehall threatens that he will make Johnson watch as he experiments on his daughter, the way he experimented on his wife. Raina explains to him that Ward has taken Skye to him for his own purposes, and he therefore realizes that he shouldn't trust Ward either, then orders Skye, Johnson, and Ward to be taken off and bound, while he prepares to enter the city.<ref name="AoS210">''[[What They Become|Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 2.10: What They Become]]''</ref><ref name="AoS2 Temple Last Week">In ''Who You Are'', May states "Last week, we took [Skye] to that city."

*[[Wilson Fisk]]'s attorney, [[Benjamin Donovan]], visits Fisk in prison, and warns him that the case was not looking good for him due to the long list of crimes he was being held accountable for.<ref name="DD209 Fisk Dates">In the episode ''[[Daredevil (episode)|Daredevil]]'', Fisk is imprisoned on the reasoned date of February 16th. In ''[[Seven Minutes in Heaven]]'', flashbacks are shown chronicling his time in prison between February 16th and November 17th. From Donovan telling Fisk his case is not going well to Fisk telling Donovan to help out Finney and the Valdezes' families seems to be not long after his imprisonment, due to his wounds having not healed too much. It is a slow, scarring heal though, as is evident from the remaining scar in November. It is shown that he has a notepad beginning on "10/12", and the next notepad has a "10/24" date on page 6. With the notepads approximately 20 pages long, this is 5 complete pages in, ¼, so 1¼ pads is about 12 days, meaning one pad is about 10 days.
<br>Fisk is shown keeping his pads in stacks of four. About 13 pads can be seen in Fisk's cell, three stacks of 4 plus one he holds that he then puts on top. Where he's sitting, he appears to be obscuring another stack, and if not, there may well be another in his bedside cabinet, so he is roughly on his 17th pad on November 14th. So, a pad began on October 12th, meaning another around October 22nd, another around November 1st, and another, the 17th, around November 11th. Therefore, working backwards, the 1st pad began around June 4th.
<br>With Donovan telling Fisk his case is not going well on Day 1 and Fisk telling Donovan to help out Finney and the Valdezes' families on Day 5, Day 3 can then be approximately placed halfway between February 16th and June 4th, around April 11th, meaning the scenes between those events are April 9th-13th. This is approximately 20% into the flashbacks, which makes sense in terms of the amount his cut has healed compared to the beginning and the end.
<br>Fisk makes notes from June 4th to November 14th, when Finney approaches him to talk about the Punisher. In that scene, he also references learning about a deal made between Dutton's lieutenant and the Aryans on "the 22nd", assumed to refer to the most recent 22nd - October 22nd. This matches almost perfectly with the fact that the exact note can be seen in his notepad on "10/24" (assuming he just noted it 2 days later).</ref><ref name="DD209"/>

However, Derrickson also says that Strange recovers for 3-6 months, and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYxmUMCNxCo Mads Mikkelsen says Strange trains for "9 months" before his clash with Kaecilius], which overall would suggest the film ends 12-15 months after Strange's car crash, thus placing the ending around February-May 2017. This, in turn, using Derrickson's comment about "a little over a year" ("early" one season to  "late" the same season a year later would mean 4⅔ seasons, so about 14 months), would, working backwards, place the opening of the film between December 2015 and February 2016 (the latest it can be, before Strange's car crash).<br>Overall, using weighted math from all the evidence available, the details of which can be seen [[User:Marvelus/Phase Three Timeline#Doctor Strange|here]], the result is that the opening is October 13, 2015, the car crash February 2, 2016, the argument with Christine March 29, 2016, Strange's arrival in Kathmandu May 4, 2016, and the climax January 18-19, 2017.<br>This would put the opening still in the early part of fall (working with Derrickson's comment), the argument with Christine towards the end of the snowy period and a bit after winter, but enough time after Strange's crash and a good time for the heavy rain (a bit later than Derrickson's comment but realistic), his arrival in Kathmandu 3 months after his crash (just fitting inside Derrickson's 3-6 months comment), the climax another 8.5 months later (just fitting for Mikkelsen's "9 months" comment), and the climax a bit after Fall 2016, instead Winter 2016-17 (a bit later than Derrickson's comment) but fitting as "a little over a year" (15 months) after the opening (fitting reasonably with Derrickson's comment), a realistic time of year for the snowfall at the Ancient One's death, and working with the other comments just described.

It has to be no earlier than November 18, 2015, as Wilder and Minoru played ''Star Wars Battlefront'' for a while before Minoru's death, and that was released on November 17, 2015. It can be assumed that the annual sacrifice is usually on a Friday early in December, as it is in 2017, making it either Friday 4th or Friday 11th in 2015. When Wilder logs onto the PlayStation, it says that the last time Minoru played the game was "2 years ago". The system for such operating systems is to round to the nearest integer below the exact number of years it has been, which means that "2 years ago" means between 2.000 and 2.999 years, so the last time Minoru played was no later than December 7, 2015, meaning her death, being later that evening, cannot have been later than December 7, 2015.
