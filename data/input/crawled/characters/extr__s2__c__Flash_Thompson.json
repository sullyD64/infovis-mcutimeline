The only way he's \"16\", as said in the film, is if he was born between May and October (so hadn't yet had his birthday when he was snapped and had a long time to go until his birthday when he came back), and also born no earlier than July to have not had his birthday yet in Far from Home. So July-October 2001 to be 16 when snapped and brought back and not yet had another birthday.-->"
