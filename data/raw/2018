===January===
====8th====
*'''[[Chase of Mike]]''': At the homeless camp where the [[Runaways]] are staying, the group are woken when the young man who stole the [[Fistigons]], nicknamed [[Mike on a Bike]], causing problems as he tries using them. The Runaways proceed to chase him out of the camp and to a nearby hill in order to retrieve the gloves. They manage to scare him with the help of [[Old Lace]] to make him leave the Fistigons, but [[Karolina Dean]] falls into a hole in the hill. As the group go to check on her, they find she is safely flying, and has accidentally discovered an abandoned [[Hostel|hostel]].<ref name="R2 December 2017-January 2018 Placement">''[[Runaways (TV series)|Runaways]]'': [[Runaways (TV series)/Season Two|Season 2]] begins with a scene set a little over "24 hours" after the end of Season 1, which was December 24, 2017 (see [[2017]] references), making it December 25, 2017. The show then proceeds the following day, December 26, 2017. However, there is an undefined gap between Alex Wilder returning to the group with sleeping bags and burner phones and the group being woken by Mike on a Bike one morning soon after. While the group are in the same clothes, they do not have changes of clothes yet while they are on the run.<br>The season continues from there, with the main events of Episode 4 - ''[[Old School]]'' 3 days later said to be a "Thursday", and it is during the school term, making it at least Thursday, January 11, 2018 and thus the Mike on a Bike scene at least Monday, January 8, 2018, so minimum 13 days passing between Wilder returning to the group and Mike on a Bike turning up. this is a stretch, with it implied that the Mike on a Bike scene is very shortly after Wilder returning, but is just about possible. However, a further week - if ''Old School'' needed to be Thursday, January 18th instead, would be highly implausible, and any more weeks would be near-impossible.<br>In Episode 5 - ''[[Rock Bottom]]'', the following day, Chase Stein and Wilder joke about their time since running away, and refer to "one Thursday in there". This suggests at least three Thursdays since their running away, which supports it being at least Friday, January 12, 2018 - and again, likely not much later.<br>2 days later, in Episode 7 - ''[[Last Rites]]'', Nico Minoru says that life was normal "2 months ago", making it currently between 1 and 2 months since December 8, 2017 (see [[2017]] references), again supporting at least a 13-day span in that undefined break in ''[[Gimmie Shelter]]'' and making it at least Sunday, January 14, 2018, and definitely no later than Sunday, February 4, 2018 (which would involve a 34-day span in the ''Gimmie Shelter'' gap, nearly impossible).<br>In ''Gimmie Shelter'', Darius Davis says on December 26, 2017 that his son is due in "2 weeks". His wife Tamar leaves hospital with his son in ''[[Past Life (Runaways)|Past Life]]'', approximately 9 days after the Mike on a Bike scene. Therefore, with that being no earlier than Monday, January 8, 2018 as established, this should be no earlier than roughly Wednesday, January 16, 2018, 3 weeks after Davis' comment. This is acceptable if you assume Davis was rounding down from a little over 2 weeks, and Tamar had to stay for a couple of days, but any later would not work. This confirms that the Mike on a Bike scene should be no later than Monday, January 8, 2018, as well as no earlier, which was confirmed above.<br>In ''[[Hostile Takeover]]'', it is said to be "Wednesday". However, it seems to only be about 8 days since Gert Yorkes stated in ''Old School'' that it was "Thursday". So, to make this work, 5 extra off-screen days need to pass in the time between ''Old School'' and ''Hostile Takeover'', so have been added where possible, taking ''Hostile Takeover'' to Wednesday, January 24, 2018. The events of Season 2 following the Mike on a Bike scene in ''Gimmie Shelter'' therefore take place January 8-28, 2018.<br>Scenes in ''Gimmie Shelter'' between Wilder returning to the group and Mike on a Bike are placed in the most appropriate dates between December 26, 2017 and January 8, 2018.<br>In ''Past Life'', Alex Wilder's phone says "10/07/2018 01:54am", but it is daytime so it is clearly incorrect anyway, and the date does not match with it being mere weeks since December 2017, as well as confirmation from Jeph Loeb that it is set before ''Avengers: Infinity War'' ([https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/8pbxyk/im_jeph_loeb_head_of_marvel_tv_ama/e0a5ju5/ 1], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UqrlizXWIM&t=2015s 2]), so before May 2018. The song ''Bubblin'' by Anderson .Paak is also played in-universe in ''Past Life'', suggesting it is at least May 2018, after the song's release, but this must also be taken as simply an error. Finally, Leslie Dean is shown to be a few months pregnant in the season. While this would imply a few months at least since Jonah was healed by Andre Compton's sacrifice, this is impossible, so it must be taken that either the baby was conceived at a time before Jonah had fallen into a fully scaled state, or the gestation period is faster due to being half-alien.</ref><ref name="R201"/>

*In a bar in [[Hokkaido]], [[Japan]], at 4AM local time [[Ward Meachum]] asks a man about his employer selling on the black market. The man denies this, but Meachum continues to inquire, asking about [[Hancock Transport]] and the body inside, saying he wants to talk to the man who sent it, [[Orson Randall]], whom he knows is the man's boss. The man denies knowledge of Randall, but Meachum says they have had a rough time tracking him through [[Hong Kong]], [[Kuala Lumpur]], and a mess in [[Jakarta]], which causes the man to realize Meachum was involved in the stealing of their missing shipment from Jakarta. As a thug working for the man stands to threaten Meachum, Meachum turns to Danny Rand, sitting nearby. The man tells Rand that Randall wants his property back, and Rand reveals he has it: two special pistols at his side. The man shoots at Rand, but Rand lights up both his fists, his chi restored and now in both hands, and the energy channeled through both weapons, and fires two chi-charged bullets, converging on the man's bullet and knocking it out of the air. He facetiously remarks that the man should not try that again.<ref name="IF2/DD3 Late 2017 Placement"/><ref name="IF210"/>

A [[Amy Bendix|girl]] comes and orders a drink, with owner [[Ringo]] judging her as acceptable to serve despite looking potentially underage. Castle surveys her, and she is defensive, telling him to look away and calling him "Rough Road". When he asks if she is okay, she unconvincingly claims she is before walking away.<ref name="TP2 Spring 2018 Placement">In ''[[Fight or Flight]]'', ''Restless'' by Ryan Innes plays on the radio, indicating it is set after April 13, 2018, when the song was released. In ''[[One Bad Day]]'', it is shown that events following the duel at the Central Park carousel in ''[[Memento Mori]]'', dated to December 13, 2016, are "one year ago" (with Madani also saying this in the episode), suggesting late 2017, or, if the flashback scene is early January 2017, then early 2018. Then, during the robbery scene, a calendar is shown with days/dates and holidays aligning exactly with May 2018 (also fitting ''Restless''). It is stated to be Friday, making it Friday 4th, 11th, 18th, or 25th, with the flashback presumably early January 2017. The current boxes and files employees are shown to be using are also shown to say "2018", further affirming the year. In ''[[My Brother's Keeper]]'', a banner is up for an event on "APRIL 18-20", but can be assumed to have just been left up afterward. In ''[[Flustercluck]]'', 2 days later, a phone calendar is shown saying it is the 13th, placing the robbery on Friday, May 11, 2018. ''[[The Abyss]]'' contains confirmation that it is after the events of ''[[A New Napkin]]'', dated to November 2017 (see [[2017]] references). It also shows an ID valid "01/18"-"01/20", again further affirming that it is 2018, not 2017. It is also still sunny after 19:19, so between approximately March 18th and September 14th, fitting with the May setting. Brett Mahoney also says it is Tuesday, 2 days after the phone indicated it was the 13th, fitting with it being Tuesday, May 15, 2018. So, the season's main events can be placed from April 28 (27 including the flashbacks comprising the majority of ''[[Roadhouse Blues]]''), 2018 to May 17, 2018.<br>Jeph Loeb stated that all Marvel Television released between April 2018 and April 2019 is set before the Snap of ''Avengers: Infinity War'' ([https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/8pbxyk/im_jeph_loeb_head_of_marvel_tv_ama/e0a5ju5/ 1], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UqrlizXWIM&t=2015s 2]). The placement of ''The Punisher'': Season 2 does end up contributing to the Snap being as late as its May 31, 2018 placement (see other references), but, simultaneously, an approximate May 31, 2018 placement for the Snap is suggested regardless, so the main events of ''The Punisher'': Season 2 finishing by May 17, 2018 fit accordingly. The only issue is the "three months later" epilogue scene of ''The Whirlwind'', which would occur in August 2018, after the Snap. However, this is not enough to contradict the clear April-May 2018 placement of the main events (nor push the Snap to August, with plenty of evidence placing it in the first half of 2018 - see other references). It must be assumed that Frank Castle and Dinah Madani survived the Snap. The scene itself provides no contradiction to the event of the Snap, and can comfortably be set after.</ref><ref name="TP201"/>

It should first be established that ''Avengers: Infinity War'' takes place over a little under 24 hours, from Wednesday (as shown on Tony Stark's flip phone) to Thursday.<br>As for ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'', Episode 19 - ''[[Option Two]]'' to Episode 22 - ''[[The End]]'' take place concurrently with ''Avengers: Infinity War'' over Wednesday-Thursday. Episode 18 - ''[[All Roads Lead...]]'' ends 9 days before ''Option Two'' (see other references), so the prior Monday. Working backwards, Episode 14 - ''[[The Devil Complex]]'', takes place earlier the Thursday 4 days before that.<br>Overall:
*Thursday Week 1 - Episode 14 - ''The Devil Complex''. Beginning of Episode 15 - ''Rise and Shine'' events.

Now it needs to be established which weeks in the timeline this applies to.<br>First, there is a latest possible date for the events of ''Avengers: Infinity War''. The Wednesday of ''Avengers: Infinity War'' is still during school time, as Peter Parker is on a school field trip. ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' establishes that Parker restarted [http://www.slashfilm.com/spider-man-homecoming-2-avengers-4/ junior year] after returning in the Blip, making him a junior at the time of the Snap. With Parker beginning sophomore year in ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' in September 2016, he would finish junior year in June 2018. This means that the Wednesday of ''Avengers: Infinity War'' should be before Tuesday, June 26, 2018, when New York high schools finished for summer ([http://schools.nyc.gov/Calendar/default.htm 1], [http://www.hsas-lehman.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Calendar17-18.pdf 2], [http://hsmse.org/about-us/school-calendar/ 3]). If necessary, it can be assumed that either Parker's school finished 1 day later than most, or the New York high schools in the ''MCU'' finished 1 day later than those in the real world, making Wednesday, June 27, 2018 the absolute latest that ''Avengers: Infinity War'' could begin.<br>The earliest possible date is January 2018, as all these events must take place in 2018.

*The ''Captain Marvel'' mid-credits scene, 3 weeks after ''Avengers: Infinity War'', is 23 years after the main events of the film, which are firmly placed in June 1995.

*''Avengers: Infinity War'' takes place 5 years before ''Avengers: Endgame'', which takes place 9 years after 2014 (so 2023).
**In ''Avengers: Endgame'', it is shown that the events are "five years later" after 3 weeks after ''Avengers: Infinity War''. It is further confirmed that ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' takes place in "2014" on-screen. In these scenes, Ebony Maw says Nebula is from "9 years" in the future, making it 2023.
*''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'': Season 5, Episodes 14-22 take place in 2018.
**In Episode 8 - ''[[The Last Day]]'', a flashforward is shown with events that, as shown in Episode 22 - ''The End'', would take place on the Thursday of ''Avengers: Infinity War'', and the on-screen text specifically says "2018".
**The agents return to the present day in Episode 11 - ''[[All the Comforts of Home]]''. Later that day, Yo-Yo Rodriguez has her arms sliced off. The agents perform surgery on her amputated arms, and she begins to heal. 2 days later, in Episode 12 - ''[[The Real Deal]]'', the monitor by her bed shows "12-06-2017", making it December 6, 2017 (see [[2017]] references for reasons this is a firm placement). By Episode 14 - ''The Devil Complex'', the skin on Rodriguez's arm stumps has healed over, which takes 4 weeks to 2 months ([https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/definition-amputation#2-5 1], [https://www.sharecare.com/health/amputation-physical-disability/take-to-recover-from-amputation 2]). With Rodriguez having lost her arms and had surgery performed on them on December 4, 2017, earliest that ''The Devil Complex'' can take place is January 2018, thus meaning that from Episode 14 onward, it is 2018.
**In Episode 15 - ''Rise and Shine'', events set at the time of [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D./Season Three|Season 3]], Episode 17 - ''[[The Team]]'' and Episode 18 - ''[[The Singularity]]'' in April 2016 are shown on-screen to have been "2 years ago".
**In Episode 16 - ''Inside Voices'', events set immediately after [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D./Season One|Season 1]], Episode 22 - ''[[Beginning of the End]]'' in January 2014 are shown on-screen to have been "four years ago".
So, all of these events take place in the first half of 2018. However, there is contradictory evidence for when exactly in the first 6 months of the year. ''Avengers: Infinity War'', ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'', ''The Punisher'', and ''Jessica Jones'' would suggest closer to June 2018, while ''Thor: Ragnarok'', ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'', and ''Spider-Man: Far From Home'' would suggest closer to January 2018.<br>Scott Lang's 2-year house arrest coming to an end would imply that it has been 24 months since the end of the main events of ''Captain America: Civil War''. In that film, Lang is arrested on June 24, 2016 (a firmly established date - see [[2016]] references). Steve Rogers breaks him out of the Raft 2 days later, on June 26, 2016, and very soon after (as shown in ''[[Avengers: Infinity War Prelude]]''), Lang returns home after making his deal. The exact date that the sentence would end depends on a few factors, such as when the sentence counts as beginning from, if it counts from his initial imprisonment then whether each day spent in prison counts as double towards his sentence, and if time could be/was removed. At the earliest, the house arrest would finish on June 20, 2018. At the latest, June 27, 2018. The arrest finishes on a Wednesday, and at the very shortest, the events of ''Avengers: Infinity War'' start 1 week later (as at least one more weekend is shown to occur before the end of the film) on the following Wednesday. The very last day that the events of ''Avengers: Infinity War'' can possibly begin is Wednesday, June 27, 2018, so the latest Lang's house arrest could end would also be the earliest: Wednesday, June 20, 2018. This would also line up well with the references to the time between previous films and ''Avengers: Infinity War'', with them placing it ideally closer to mid-2018 than early.<br>However, there are several things in ''Thor: Ragnarok'', ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'', and ''Spider-Man: Far From Home'' suggesting it is much earlier in the year.
*Firstly, ''Thor: Ragnarok'' is firmly set in 2017 (see [[2017]] references). At the very latest, it takes place in November-December 2017, before ''All the Comforts of Home'' on December 4, 2017, which features a reference to the events of the film. There is a jump in time between the end of the main events of the film and the film's mid-credits scene, which is set mere minutes before the opening of ''Avengers: Infinity War''. However, the gap should be minimal, for several reasons:
**The film finishes with Thor deciding to head back to Earth. Only in the mid-credits scene do he and Loki seem to actually begin discussing the problems with bringing Loki back to the planet. This would imply that it is very soon after the decision was made.
**Thor's hair is exactly the same in ''Avengers: Infinity War'' as it is in ''Thor: Ragnarok'', including the streak on the side from the Watcher Informant's poor cutting. While it's possible that Asgardian hair grows slower than humans', it nonetheless implies very little time has passed.
**The ''Statesman'' has a few hundred Asgardians on board that need food and water and other general living standards, and the ship itself is highly unlikely to have enough on board to sustain a few hundred people for very long. It is possible that they could have gone a little longer if one assumes they stopped at other places for resources on the way and/or that Asgardians need less sustenance than humans, but nonetheless, the longer the gap, the more and more assumptions have to me made.
*''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'': Episode 12 - ''The Real Deal'' is firmly set on December 6, 2017, as given by the "12-06-2017" date on Rodriguez's monitor, and which lines up with all the other evidence as mentioned above. Episode 13 - ''Principia'' takes place shortly after and, as is evidenced by the "12-17-2017" date and Coulson's mention of "tidings of comfort of joy", it is Christmas. When Episode 14 - ''The Devil Complex'' begins, it is heavily implied to be merely another several days later:
**In Episode 12 - ''The Real Deal'', the team discover that Coulson is dying. For them, it has been only a few days since Coulson made the deal with Ghost Rider, yet it has become quite bad. They do not know when he will die, but considering it took just a few days to get this bad, it would be strange for it to take several further months to kill him.
**In Episode 13 - ''Principia'', Fitz says in December 2017, "The, uh, the gravitonium device that we used to seal the rift is barely strong enough. It's duct tape on the Hoover Dam. It's not gonna hold." Coulson asks, "How much time before the dam starts leaking?", and he says, "Well, uh, it's hard to calculate that precisely, but, based on the increased frequency of transit, electromagnetic waves, I'd say that our days were numbered." While he clearly does not know exactly how long they have, the implication is absolutely no more than a couple of weeks.
**In Episode 14 - ''The Devil Complex'', Simmons says she would like to have a honeymoon with Fitz, implying they recently married. In Episode 17 - ''The Honeymoon'', Simmons jokes about this being their honeymoon, implying they recently got married.
**In Episode 14 - ''The Devil Complex'', Mackenzie is testing Rodriguez's newly made robotic arms. They got the arms from Hale's mechs in ''Principia''. Considering how fast they usually work, it really should not take them very long to make the arms.
**In Episode 14 - ''The Devil Complex'', Mackenzie says to Rodriguez, "Your arms aren't fully healed yet. What you need is time." Rodriguez replies, "My arms may not work, but my eyes do. At least let me sit in Control, keep an eye out for anomalies." Mackenzie says, "Maybe, but you have to allow yourself to heal. We'll handle the fighting for now." As well as this, Rodriguez is still in her hospital-esque bed for a lot of the episode. This implies that she is still healing and still needs to be taken care of, which should not be for more than a couple of months absolute maximum.
**In Episode 14 - ''The Devil Complex'', Deke Shaw is still a bit dazed about having worked out that Fitz and Simmons are his grandparents.
**In Episode 14 - ''The Devil Complex'', Fitz says, "Well, I've temporarily plugged the dam, but it could burst at any minute, releasing more of these anomalies into the base." The phrasing implies the temporary plugging was recent.
*In Episode 14 - ''The Devil Complex'', snow is shown on the ground, suggesting it is still winter.
*In Episode 15 - ''Rise and Shine'', Coulson says to Hale, "Listen, my team wasn't hiding all these months. We traveled to the future." From this, it can be taken that it has only been "months" since May 12, 2017, when the agents were sent to the future. While it has to now be 2018, it should not be later than early 2018. As well as this, this piece of dialogue suggests that the amount of time that his team have been back in the present is negligible, because he is generalizing the whole time since May 12, 2017 as the time that they were not around, but in the future.
*In ''[[Missing Pieces]]'', Enoch says he was going to protect Fitz for the next "73 years, 261 days". The team are in 2091, so if they left the future as early as possible, December 31, 2091, then since Fitz wakes 4 days prior, the latest he can possibly have woken is December 27, 2091. Even if Fitz were to wake as late as possible, the latest this scene could be is then April 10, 2018. Except the scene is implied to after ''The End'', since it should be after the split in the timeline (seemingly not possible to have happened in the original timeline), suggesting ''The End'' should be no later than April 10, 2018.
*In ''[[Fear and Loathing on the Planet of Kitson]]'', Enoch says he is planning to orbit Jupiter with Fitz for the next "72 years, 312 days", which should end before he takes Fitz to the Lighthouse. Fitz wakes no later than December 27, 2091, so the latest ''Fear and Loathing on the Planet of Kitson'' could possibly be is February 18, 2019. However, it is 13 months on from ''The End'' (Coulson and May "got more [time] than [they] thought [they] would", so Coulson lived roughly the "weeks" Simmons mentions he might have if he is lucky in ''The End'', and ''Missing Pieces'' ends on the 1-year anniversary of Coulson's death, the same day ''Fear and Loathing on the Planet of Kitson'' is set - plus it is mentioned that Fitz died "over a year ago"), so ''The End'' would have to finish in January 2018.
*In ''Spider-Man: Far From Home'', Betty Brant says, "Even though we had blipped away halfway through the school year and had already taken midterms." This would make it approximately January/February. There is wiggle room for it to loosely mean "halfway", just "in the bulk of", "not at the beginning or end of", but it should still be no later than May 2018, so it is not in the final several weeks of term. This essentially confirms that Lang did not serve a full 24 months, as ''Avengers: Infinity War'' cannot be as late as June 2018 following this comment.
Furthermore, ''[[The Punisher]]'': [[The Punisher/Season Two|Season 2]], which firmly places itself in April-May 2018 (see other references). Jeph Loeb stated in July 2018, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UqrlizXWIM&t=2015s "The short answer is that the stories that you're seeing, unless otherwise noted, all happen before <nowiki>[...]</nowiki> what is affectionately referred to as "The Thanos Snap". And we'll continue to be in that place until we find out what happens in ''Avengers 4'',"] referring to all ''Marvel Cinematic Universe'' television released before April 26, 2019. This would place ''The Punisher'': Season 2 (released in January 2019) before ''Avengers: Infinity War'' (save for the "three months later" epilogue of ''The Whirlwind'', which is August 2018, so has to be after ''Avengers: Infinity War'' no matter what), thereby making ''Avengers: Infinity War'' set in at least May 2018. However, this is also the only answer Loeb could feasibly give, and he does not explicitly cover every single season, nor specifically ''The Punisher'': Season 2 (saying only that the shows will be set before [https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/8pbxyk/im_jeph_loeb_head_of_marvel_tv_ama/e0a5ju5/ "for the most part"] on a prior occasion), so it is possible that the one season being set after ''Avengers: Infinity War'' is not a hard contradiction to Loeb's comments, but April 2018 would be no more than 3 months maximum after Thanos snaps his fingers, and to see no acknowledgement of this in the world so shortly after is highly unlikely. Placing the Snap in May 2018, all pushing and pulling factors considered, makes sense as a compromise anyway, so the Snap should indeed be placed after the main events of ''The Punisher'': Season 2. Thursday, May 17, 2018 would make the most sense (mere hours after the end of the main events), as it is as early as possible, to be as far away as possible from the end of school term in conjunction with the "halfway" ''Spider-Man: Far From Home'' line.<br>A final complication comes from ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]'': [[Jessica Jones (TV series)/Season Three|Season 3]]. Most evidence would place it in November-December 2018, but this would be just about 6 months post-Snap, with zero acknowledgement of such a monumental, worldwide long-lasting trauma effect. Ultimately, the best-fitting placement is April-May 2018 instead (see other references), allowing it to be pre-Snap. However, in that case, the season ends on May 27, 2018, making the earliest the Snap can be Thursday, May 31, 2018. So, using this earliest possible placement (as any later would contradict ''Spider-Man: Far From Home'', and late May is already much closer to the later evidence than the earlier), ''Avengers: Infinity War'' and its related events can be placed on May 30-31, 2018, with the main events of ''The Devil Complex'' to ''All Roads Lead...'' therefore being May 17-21, 2018.<br>A laptop early in ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' has the date [https://i2.wp.com/caps.pictures/201/7-antman-wasp/full/antman-wasp-movie-screencaps.com-1217.jpg?strip=all "4/30/2018"]. With the idea of Lang's house arrest being 24 months thrown out, so ''Ant-Man and the Wasp''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s placement flexible - and the events of ''Avengers: Infinity War'' being mid-to-late May 2018, late April-early May 2018 for the main events of ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' would make sense. The main events of ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' begin on a Sunday, with Cassie saying, "I had a fun weekend." Scott has 3 days remaining of his house arrest sentence, and the sentence finishes right after the climax, making that Wednesday. Working back, Scott's dream in the bath is Monday night, meaning the house arrest montage spans Sunday and Monday. April 30, 2018 is a Monday, so this aligns for the main events to be Sunday, April 29, 2018 to Wednesday, May 2, 2018.</ref><ref name="AoS518-19 9 Days">Deke Shaw is shot in the arm in Episode 17 - ''[[The Honeymoon]]'', the day before the end of ''[[All Roads Lead...]]''. Following this, he wears a sling until the beginning of Episode 21 - ''[[The Force of Gravity]]''. This should mean that several weeks pass between him being shot and having the sling taken off. However, the only possible gap in time is between ''All Roads Lead...'' and ''Option Two'', and the show treats it very much like it has been merely hours when ''Option Two'' begins. This would in total mean that Deke had the sling for barely over 1 day, which is impossible. Stretching the gap between ''All Roads Lead...'' and ''Option Two'', it really can be no more than about 5 days, considering the agents' actions, discussions, and behavior. However, even if we consider that the surgery on Shaw was very successful and he healed very fast and took off the sling very prematurely - as soon as he could, to help him be more able in the times of crisis that were occurring, it really cannot be shorter than about 2 weeks of recovery time, which would involve a 13-day gap between ''All Roads Lead...'' and ''Option Two''. Overall, a 9-day jump is necessary, giving 10 days of recovery time before taking off the sling. It absolutely cannot be any longer, yet it absolutely cannot be shorter. So, with ''Option Two'' being the Wednesday of ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'', the main events of ''All Roads Lead...'' end on the previous week's Monday.<br>Working backwards, ''All Roads Lead...'' begins the day before (Sunday), and Episode 16 - ''[[Inside Voices]]'' and 17 - ''The Honeymoon'' are earlier that Sunday. In ''Inside Voices'', Ruby Hale says, "Why not talk to Coulson [...] I think after 2 days in isolation," which places the "24 hours ago" portion of Episode 15 - ''[[Rise and Shine]]'' as being 2 days prior, Friday, thus meaning that ''Rise and Shine'' spans the Thursday-Saturday almost 2 weeks before ''Avengers: Infinity War''. The exact dates assigned to these days are May 17-21, 2018 (see other references).</ref><ref name="AMatW"/>

Firstly, Scott goes to Maggie Lang's house and hugs Cassie. While this can be interpreted as the first thing he does after release, he has changed clothes and asks Cassie "You ready?", implying he is picking her up. On Sunday, April 29, 2018, when Cassie says, "I had a fun weekend, Daddy," Scott replies, "Me too, Peanut. Just wait till next weekend." So, this should not be until the weekend after Scott's release, making it Saturday, May 5, 2018.<br>Following this is Luis securing the Karapetyan deal. With news from the San Francisco chase playing and the group being busy receiving calls, it appears to be shortly after May 2, 2018. While the trio missed their Karapetyan meeting on May 2nd, Karapetyan would presumably not wait too long to get in contact. Since Kurt is arranging a meeting for "Monday", this would suggest it is not currently Sunday or Monday. Tuesday, May 8, 2018 is too far from the main events of the film, so the other option, to be taken, is Saturday, May 5, 2018, hours after Scott picks up Cassie. He is in the same clothes. Presumably she is just not with him at that moment.<br>Hank Pym and Janet van Dyne then go to the beach, then Hope van Dyne sits with Scott and Cassie in a car to watch ''Them!''. These can be distributed between May 5th and May 31st, making the ''Them!'' scene approximately May 22nd. However, this is not a weekend, and Scott seems to only have Cassie on weekends. The closest weekend day is May 20th. Then, placing the beach scene halfway between May 5th daytime and May 20th evening would put it around the morning of May 13th.</ref><ref name="AMatW"/>

*Fitz tries to ask [[Deke Shaw]] about gravitonium but he is distant, thinking about Fitz and Simmons being his grandparents. When they get his attention, he explains that he does not now much about the material. Fitz and Simmons leave to look for [[Franklin Hall]]'s notes for further insight, and [[Daisy Johnson]] gets a location on General [[Hale]]'s phone, believing her to have slipped up.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS514"/>

*Piper tells [[Melinda May]] that they cannot move the [[Sleeper Mechs|Sleeper Mech]] that was serving as Hale's driver, as it is too heavy, almost like a statue. May goes to the car, realizing who it is, and calls the driver out as [[Carl Creel]], asking him to get out.

*A jet sent by Hale docks on Zephyr One, and Piper apologizes to May and Coulson for leading them into another trap, but Coulson says it is his fault this time.

*Fitz arrives downstairs and asks Simmons, Mackenzie, and Rodriguez about the Sleeper Mech who attacked.

[[File:Superior1-TDC.jpg|thumb|250px|Ivanov walks out onto [[Zephyr One]]]]

*[[Phil Coulson]] and Melinda May are taken before Hale, Creel, and Ivanov. They explain that Ivanov was behind [[Glenn Talbot]] being shot, not Daisy Johnson, but Hale says that they have proof Ivanov was programmed by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] originally. She says Coulson has to come with her to prevent harm to the agents. Coulson agrees, to May's dismay, and she tries to convince him not to go.

*[[Alphonso Mackenzie]] stands guard for [[Yo-Yo Rodriguez]]. She tells him not to worry since she is safe, because they know she lives past 2018 from having spoken to her [[2091]] self. Mackenzie points out that they are trying to prevent that future and hoping it is not cemented, so she might still die, but Rodriguez comments that if she does, then at least that would mean they have broken the time loop.

[[File:Simmons TooRiskyOperation.png|thumb|250px|Simmons confronts Fitz]]
*The Doctor tells Fitz he is removing Johnson's inhibitor, and Fitz is horrified. The two Fitzes argue, and Daisy Johnson becomes confused. Simmons enters and suddenly Fitz stops seeing the Doctor, and does not understand, but Simmons explains to him what she has worked out: the Doctor was never there. He was not an anomaly from the [[Fear Dimension]], but a result of a psychic split Fitz is experiencing following his time in the [[Framework]], with the Doctor personality taking control over the day and having got Fitz to separate Johnson from the others.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS514"/>
*Upset, Fitz begins to slip back into his dangerous Doctor mindset, and says that this personality simply has the will to do what Fitz does not: to risk Johnson's paralysis and the destruction of the Earth in order to restore Johnson's powers so she can compress the [[gravitonium]] and they can close the rift that endangers the planet. He refuses to deactivate the [[Sleeper Mechs]] that arrive and hold Simmons, as well as the now-arriving [[Deke Shaw]], at bay, and removes the inhibitor. Johnson mutters that she will never forgive him.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS514"/>

*Jemma Simmons visits Leo Fitz outside his cell in the [[Lighthouse]] and tries to reassure him that it was not him, but Fitz is not convinced, explaining that while he feels bad about it, even in his right mind he does not regret what he did, believing it to have been the best option. Simmons is saddened by his words, and the couple admit that they do not know what comes next for their relationship.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS514"/>
*Deke Shaw goes to see Simmons and comforts her. As they talk, he reveals to her that he knows about their relationship and that it persists, because it is the relationship his mother would tell him about when she discussed her parents - because Fitz and Simmons are his grandparents. Overwhelmed by the revelations and emotions of the day, Simmons vomits.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS514"/>

*As they walk through the academy, General Hale reveals to [[Phil Coulson]] that they are working on a project initiated by [[Daniel Whitehall]], and Coulson reveals that he was the one to kill him. Hale explains that the project is intended to create not just a super soldier like [[Captain America]], but someone of immense power, and that Ruby was created to be the subject of the project. However, she says that Ruby is too emotionally volatile, and that she believes [[Daisy Johnson]] is a better fit. Hale tells him that the project is called "[[Project Destroyer of Worlds]]", and suddenly Coulson panics, realizing this is the origin of Johnson's nickname in the future, and thus the beginning of the events leading to the destruction of the planet.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS515"/>
*Desperate to do anything he can to stop Hale's plans, Coulson confesses the truth of where he and his team were for the 7 months in which they were missing, telling her about going to the future and what he saw.

Johnson bursts in and says that this is not an option as he cannot be trusted. May tells Johnson to remember that he is on their side, but Johnson says not to defend him. Fitz states that he cannot apologize because in doing what he did, he saved the lives of the town of [[River's End]], as well as potentially many more if the rift had continued to grow. She says that they do not turn on each other, but Fitz points out that she has done it herself.

Hale shows little care for this, remarking that there are not many people left who she cares about. [[Werner von Strucker]] returns to the room, having found [[Anton Ivanov]]'s dead body, which gives Fitz and Simmons some hope that [[Yo-Yo Rodriguez]] escaped.

Mackenzie recalls his encounter with [[Glenn Talbot]] at the security feeds several hours prior, and realizes that Talbot must have paused the feed to allow him to go after Robin.

He threatens [[Loki]], telling him that if he does not hand over the [[Tesseract]], containing the [[Space Stone]], then he will use the Power Stone to brutally murder Thor. While Thor insists that the Tesseract was destroyed [[Ragnarök|along with Asgard]], Loki reveals the truth: that he stole it before awakening [[Surtur]].

Thanos, however, uses the newly acquired powers of the Space Stone to immobilize Loki's arm, and proceeds to grab Loki by the neck. As the life is choked out of him, Loki spitefully tells Thanos that he will never be a god, but the strangling eventually kills Loki, and Thanos throws his body aside.

They are suddenly interrupted when Doctor Strange opens a portal next to them and steps out to tell Stark that they need his help, and the universe is at stake. Stark is not sure whether to trust Strange until Bruce Banner steps out from behind the sorcerer, reuniting with his friend after 3 years in space.

The group realize they need to contact [[Vision]], who has the [[Mind Stone]] embedded in his head, but Stark explains that he has been off-the-radar for a fortnight, and that the only way to find him might well be calling [[Steve Rogers]]. When Banner is confused by why this might be a problem, Stark explains what happened in [[2016]], when the [[Avengers Civil War|Avengers were broken]] by the conflict between him and Rogers. However, Banner still insists that Stark should put the grudge aside considering the stakes at play, and Stark reluctantly gets out the burner flip-phone Rogers had left him.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AIW"/>

**Meanwhile, Ebony Maw engages the sorcerers in battle as he attempts to steal the Time Stone, meeting their magical attacks with his own. He binds Strange to the wall but is unable to touch the [[Eye of Agamotto]] without being burned, since Strange has cast a spell preventing anyone else from taking it so long as he survives. The [[Cloak of Levitation]] allows him to escape from the bindings, but Maw gives chase.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AIW"/>

**As Ebony Maw brings an immobilized Strange into the Q-Ship, Spider-Man clings onto the side of the ship, desperately trying not to fall from such a great height.

They convene to discuss the finalized plan to slingshot the remaining gravitonium into the Sun, but when General [[Hale]] is mentioned, Mackenzie asks for someone to explain how they lost her in [[Herefordshire]]. This sparks an argument about the morality of Rodriguez's decision, with her standing by her decision to kill Ruby Hale as necessary for saving the world and [[Leo Fitz]] and [[Jemma Simmons]] backing her up, but the others believing it was not justified. Coulson dismisses them to pursue their own individual tasks, thus breaking up the argument.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS519"/>
*<!--17:50-->Knowing that Coulson would object to their actions, May takes [[Daisy Johnson]] aside to talk in secret about their pursuit of a cure for his affliction.

*<!--19:00-->Coulson visits Talbot, and Talbot tells him about the coordinates. He says that he has realized why his [[HYDRA]] programming had led him to the hangar - he was broadcasting the location of the Lighthouse to Hale. Coulson is shocked as he realizes this means they could be under attack by [[Qovas]] and the [[Remorath]].<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS519"/>

*<!--19:05-->Coulson's team realize that the Remorath above have cut off all their communication signals to the outside world. In reaction to the threat, the Lighthouse programming automatically triggers "[[Project Reclamation|Project: Reclamation]]" - the project for which it was built, giving options for extra protection against a threat or catastrophic event. Another video of [[Rick Stoner]] begins, walking them through the options for defense. As Stoner lists the options, Coulson decides that the one most befitting their situation is "nuclear attack", prematurely selecting it before Stoner then states that there was, in fact, another option specifically for alien invasion. The nuclear attack selection locks the building down, with Stoner informing them that they are locked in for 15 years. Coulson tries to stay calm despite his mistake. He takes the tannoy to hesitantly inform the other agents of the situation they are in, adding that all being well, there should be a way out of their predicament.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS519"/>

*<!--19:15-->Talking properly for the first time in days, [[Yo-Yo Rodriguez]] tries to explain her actions to [[Alphonso Mackenzie]], knowing that he is angry at what she did.

*<!--19:18-->Rodriguez comes across [[Melinda May]], who guesses what Mackenzie told her. Understanding Rodriguez's position after having had to kill [[Katya Belyakov]] 10 years prior, she says that it will change people's perception of her, but that all she can do is to learn to live with her actions.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS519"/>
*<!--19:20-->The two agents get back to the control room, and [[Phil Coulson]] says he is worried as to why [[Daisy Johnson]] has not yet returned. May confesses the truth to him, that she had ordered Johnson to go dark while she performed their secret side-mission that might help save him. On hearing this, Rodriguez begins to panic, saying that she thinks she killed [[Ruby Hale]] for nothing.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS519"/>

*<!--19:20-->Rodriguez tells Coulson about what her future self said in [[2091]], warning that they need to let him die. May argues that since [[Robin Hinton]] said Coulson will "put the pieces back together", they need to save him. However, the argument is interrupted when Coulson realizes that through the [[Phase Harmonic Teleportation Device]], the alien attackers are able to go wherever they want, and could arrive any moment.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS519"/>

*<!--19:40-->Johnson talks to [[Tony Caine]] after he has finished getting the Hintons settled in safely. He mentions that Robin drew him a picture of [[Sinara|a blue alien lady]], and remarks how strange it is dealing with aliens, asking her if she has seen the [[Attack on Greenwich Village|weird alien events happening in New York]], to which she replies that she is unable to watch the news these days as it bothers her. He moves on to telling her what he has found for Coulson, explaining that his research took him back to [[John Garrett]]'s work, and that he has found what kept Garrett alive during the [[Deathlok]] programme: [[Centipede Serum]], which he has the last remaining unit of. He hands her the unit but explains that the serum is missing a healing component designed and developed by the Nazis, and that the only clue he has to its source, a name, could not be found on any map. When Johnson looks at the name, however, she sees that it is "[[Jiaying]]", and realizes that [[HYDRA]] used her mother's healing ability to complete the serum.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS519"/>
*'''[[Siege of the Lighthouse]]''':
**<!--19:40-->Rodriguez gets to Talbot's cell and asks him to put on handcuffs.

She asks that he follow her lead.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS519"/>
**<!--19:40-->Fitz makes his way to Floor 17, where the analogue override is held, accompanied by another agent. The lights begin to flicker and Fitz's walkie-talkie stops working, making them realize that [[Remorath]] marauders must be nearby. Fitz's fellow agent then walks ahead but is ambushed by a marauder, killed on the spot. Fitz runs and comes across [[Deke Shaw]], who had gone to find him as he was afraid that if Fitz died, he would never exist. Shaw uses a fire extinguisher to ward off the marauder and the two of them run to the override room.

Agent [[Kim]] offers to go to the armory for them and Coulson decides that they have to take a stand and defend the control room. He instructs [[Yo-Yo Rodriguez]] to pick up any weaponry she can and take Talbot to them. [[Deke Shaw]] works on fixing an elevator to allow Simmons, [[Piper]], and [[Davis (Agent)|Davis]] to transport the [[gravitonium]] to the control room. Fitz warns them that the aliens have technology like EMPs that affects technology, and informs Coulson that they need to find combustible items to use as sources of light if they are going to be able to see the attackers.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS519"/>

**<!--19:55-->Piper, Davis, and Simmons barricade themselves in the lab and prepare to fight. The door begins to rattle and they raise their guns, but it is only Rodriguez and Talbot. They enter and inform Simmons that their route to the control room has been cut off, and Simmons tells Fitz on the walkie-talkie that she will have to make her stand where she is, in the lab. Rodriguez heads out with Davis and Piper to hunt their attackers, leaving Simmons and Talbot as the last line of defense.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS519"/>
**<!--19:55-->[[Alphonso Mackenzie]] joins [[Leo Fitz]] and [[Deke Shaw]] at the elevator exit as they get out. A marauder arrives in their corridor and Mackenzie shoots him, but he is unfazed. He is joined by two further marauders, who chase the agents as they run for safety.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS519"/>
**<!--20:00-->Rodriguez, Piper, and Davis struggle with the darkness in the building as they cannot see if there are marauders nearby. They shoot down the corridor in case but find nothing. However, Rodriguez uses her super-speed to scout ahead and reports back that there are several that they are about to encounter. She insists on leading the way, telling the two agents that she cannot be killed.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS519"/>
**<!--20:05-->Coulson uses the walkie-talkies to let Simmons know that he and the others are surrounded in the control room, and so she and Rodriguez should not try to get to them. Simmons is unable to warn Rodriguez, however, as she has left and Simmons is unable to exit the lab without being swarmed by attackers. Talbot picks up an [[I.C.E.R.]] to prepare to help her if any [[Remorath]] get in, but then finds the [[Particle Infusion Chamber]] chamber in the lab. Believing he can help if he is infused with the [[gravitonium]], but knowing Simmons will not let him, he I.C.E.-es her and enters the machine.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS519"/>
**<!--20:10-->Fitz gets back to the control room with a combustible cocktail he has made. He and May light fires and the team prepares for the Remorath's attack. The doors begin to shake as they try to get in, but they suddenly go quiet. The team become suspicious, then realize the Remorath are heading upwards as noises resume from above. The marauders enter from an upper floor door and the team being to shoot at their attackers.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS519"/>
**<!--20:10-->[[Yo-Yo Rodriguez]], [[Piper]], and [[Davis (Agent)|Davis]] meanwhile shoot at the marauders attacking the lab, but realize they are swarmed from all sides. Rodriguez attempts to contact Simmons but gets no response from the walkie-talkie and becomes concerned. Piper begins reminding Rodriguez that she need not be worried because the technology around them is just not working, when suddenly the lab doors are blown open. They watch as a marauder who has been knocked to the ground by the blast is dragged out of view, followed by their blood splattering across the hall. [[Glenn Talbot]] emerges, empowered by the gravitonium infused in his body.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS519"/>
**<!--20:15-->In the control room, the team run out of ammunition, with no success in having taken down the seemingly bulletproof Remorath. They begin to fight hand-to-hand, but Coulson finds himself quickly knocked to the ground. Dazed, he notices the control room door opening despite the lock-down, and is surprised to see Glenn Talbot enter. Talbot uses his newly acquired ability of manipulating the effects of gravity on people and objects to lift the marauders into the air and then crush them as they float, crumpling their bodies inwards on themselves and killing them all swiftly.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS519"/>
**<!--20:20-->Rodriguez runs into the lab and helps [[Jemma Simmons]] off the floor. They find the [[Particle Infusion Chamber]] with the reading marking it "100%", and realize, to their dismay, what Talbot has done.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS519"/>
**<!--20:20-->Talbot proudly proclaims to the agents in the control room that he has fixed things as he promised. He then uses his powers to break the ceiling of the Lighthouse and detach the portion of the floor Coulson is lying on, standing on it with him as he lifts the piece of floor up into the air and through the ceiling. The remaining agents are astonished, but the electricity comes back online and the breaking of the lock-down and lack of contamination in the scans of the atmosphere trigger a new [[Rick Stoner]] recording informing them that [[Project Reclamation|Project: Reclamation]] is over.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS519"/>

*<!--20:25-->[[Glenn Talbot]] continues to lift [[Phil Coulson]] up higher and higher into the sky, taking him to [[Qovas' Ship|Qovas' ship]] in order to end the alien situation.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS520"/>
*<!--20:25-->Arriving at Qovas' docking station, Talbot and Coulson are met by Remorath who declare them prisoners. Coulson asks Talbot what his plan is, and he says that they are going to show the aliens his position of authority over them to force them to leave, again saying he will "fix" things, which concerns Coulson.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS520"/>
*<!--20:25-->The team at the [[Lighthouse]] discuss their concern about Talbot. Simmons informs them that Talbot took in all of the gravitonium, and mentions the fact that it has catastrophic consequences, having driven [[Ruby Hale]] insane with just 8%, highlighting that with Talbot's brain injury this could cause him a major psychotic break. [[Melinda May]] declares that they need to find him and Coulson, but [[Leo Fitz]] points out that the building has only just come back online and it could be hours before the systems are fully functional. Rodriguez asks where [[Alphonso Mackenzie]] is, and [[Piper]] explains he has gone to check for any remaining [[Remorath]].<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS520"/>
*<!--20:30-->Mackenzie scouts the hallways and finds one remaining marauder. The alien ingests the same [[odium]] liquid the team encountered in [[2091]], giving him a burst of adrenaline and making rabid and super resilient. Mackenzie shoots at him, but the bullets are once again ineffective, and he has to engage the alien hand-to-hand. He manages to outsmart the alien and beat him down with his [[Shotgun-Axe]], but before he can kill him, May arrives and tells him to stop, as they need the marauder alive to attempt to acquire any information they can about what Coulson and Talbot are facing. Mackenzie knocks him out instead.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS520"/>
*<!--20:35-->Talbot and Coulson are taken before [[Qovas]], and Talbot claims the ship for himself. Qovas dismisses his claim, but Talbot uses his new powers to crush one of the Remorath the same way he had in the Lighthouse. Realizing that Talbot has the power to end their lives in an instant, Qovas and his marauders reluctantly kneel before him as he demands.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS520"/>
*<!--20:35-->[[Yo-Yo Rodriguez]] finds Mackenzie and asks if he is okay. However, when she tries to further the conversation to talk again about forgiving her, he explains that May and Simmons are waiting for him and walks away.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS520"/>
*<!--20:40-->May, Mackenzie, and Simmons interrogate the marauder they found, keeping him chained to the floor and ceiling. He rants about the liquid he consumed, telling them it is called the [[odium]], and exclaiming that it gives them the powers of the gods. He grows increasingly rabid, shaking and straining in his chains until one chain breaks, but as he does so, the odium finishes taking effect and his heart stops, dying with odium dripping out of his mouth. Simmons explains that to understand the odium better, she would have to dissect him, and the other two encourage her to do so.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS520"/>
*<!--20:40-->[[Glenn Talbot]] expresses his pride in his work, but [[Phil Coulson]] warns him that they need to plan more thoroughly and not make rash decisions. Talbot says he is saving the world, but Qovas calmly tells him that he is being ignorant, as the [[Confederacy]] will not stand for his actions, noting that [[HYDRA]] were never so foolish. This prompts Coulson to realize that [[Hale]] must be how Qovas found out their location, and requests to be taken to see her.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS520"/>
*<!--20:45-->Coulson visits Hale, and finds her repentant, having spent time alone wallowing in her grief. She explains that she has always been too angry, and never stopped to consider her love for [[Ruby Hale|Ruby]] until it was too late - that she blindly carried out HYDRA's agenda to the point where it got her daughter killed, and that makes it her fault. Coulson expresses his condolences, but asks for her help, telling her of Talbot undergoing [[Project Destroyer of Worlds]].<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS520"/>
*<!--20:50-->Coulson takes Hale back to Talbot and Qovas, and she tells them what she knows of the Confederacy. He is reluctant to trust his captor, but she apologizes for her treatment of him, and Coulson tells him they need her knowledge. Hale tells Talbot that now he is laced with the [[gravitonium]], he is the only one who can save them all, and he decides to listen. She reveals that HYDRA's deal with the Confederacy was for them to protect the Earth from attack in return for [[Inhumans]] and gravitonium, the latter of which Qovas adds is a very valuable substance due to its exceptional powers that can be used to bend space and build and destroy empires. The humans decide they have to meet with the Confederacy to make a new arrangement, which Qovas argues is against Confederacy protocol, noting they would also have nothing to bargain with. Coulson, however, argues that Talbot himself is their bargaining chip due to the gravitonium in his body.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS520"/>
*<!--21:00-->In the [[Lighthouse]], [[Leo Fitz]] worries that it could take hours to get the power working again, but it suddenly switches back on, as [[Deke Shaw]] steps out from behind the monitors and explains that he fixed it, as it was what he was good at in the future. The team receive a transmission from [[Daisy Johnson]], who explains that she has been trying to contact for 30 minutes to let them know she is arriving. Shaw tells her why they were unable to pick up, explaining about the attack they underwent.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS520"/>
*<!--21:15-->[[Yo-Yo Rodriguez]] goes to meet Johnson when she arrives, wanting to confront her for keeping her mission secret and, in her opinion, abandoning them.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS520"/>
*<!--21:20-->Johnson enters and Rodriguez demands to know what is in the bag she is carrying. When Johnson refuses, she uses her super-speed to grab the bag for herself and finds the skeleton within. She asks Johnson what is wrong with her, and Johnson hits her, starting a fight. Rodriguez uses her super-speed to repeatedly punch Johnson, but Johnson takes advantage of the moment in which Rodriguez returns to her starting point, hitting her with a quake before she can run again. [[Melinda May]] arrives and breaks up the fight, informing them that they have picked up a signal of a spaceship outside of the atmosphere, believing it to be [[Qovas' Ship|Qovas' ship]], and that once the artificial gravity is installed on [[Zephyr One]], they will be flying up to board it. She tells Rodriguez that they will continue working to help Coulson, and she can either help or leave.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS520"/>
*<!--21:20-->[[Glenn Talbot]], having trimmed his shaggy hair and beard, dons robes to prepare for the visit to the [[Confederacy]]. Coulson reminds him to be careful, but he insists he knows what he is doing. [[Qovas]] takes him to the [[Phase Harmonic Teleportation Device]], and they teleport to the Confederacy meeting.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS520"/>
*<!--21:25-->The Confederacy are surprised by Talbot's presence, and Qovas explains that he is there to renegotiate the terms of [[Earth]]'s protection. The aliens are reluctant to listen, but Talbot confidently claims he is much more than the amateurs they have dealt with in the past, calling himself "Earth's mightiest hero".<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS520"/>
*<!--21:25-->[[Deke Shaw]] goes to see [[Daisy Johnson]]. She comments on the lemons she found in her bed, believing it to be a prank, and Shaw, embarrassed that his attempt at showing affection went wrong, deflects it by saying it was probably Fitz. He says he has been meaning to tell her something since they became closer, and she tells him not to get close to her, as people close to her die, mentioning her mother and [[Lincoln Campbell]]. Shaw asks who Campbell is, and she explains his sacrifice and how much she loved him, saying she sometimes wonders if she still does. She asks what he was going to say, and he tells her of their discovery: that [[Leo Fitz]] and [[Jemma Simmons]] are his grandparents.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS520">''[[The One Who Will Save Us All|Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 5.20: The One Who Will Save Us All]]''</ref>
*<!--21:25-->Talbot asks to be added to the Confederacy, but is told that there can never be more than six members. He uses his powers to engulf Confederacy member [[Crixon]] with the [[gravitonium]] from his body, proving his might, and arrogantly proclaims that he has just freed a space for himself in the group.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS520"/>
*<!--21:25-->[[Alphonso Mackenzie]] works on [[Zephyr One]], and Leo Fitz arrives to insert the gravitonium into the ship's system to use for artificial gravity once they head to space. Fitz tries to apologize to Mackenzie for complying with locking him up before, but Mackenzie refuses to accept his support of Yo-Yo Rodriguez killing [[Ruby Hale]], telling him that the things he was saying about the predetermined future led Rodriguez down the wrong path. Fitz stands up for himself, saying that sometimes it is necessary to sacrifice a life for the sake of many, and that Hale was just too dangerous, but Mackenzie tells him he needs to take a look at his actions and think about what kind of person he wants to be, because lately he has been morally questionable.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS520"/>

He reveals that the Confederacy never intended to honor their agreement of protection, nor did they have the ability to, as is being exemplified as they speak; Taryan explains that an alien far beyond the Confederacy's might, known as [[Thanos]], is currently leading his forces in an assault on the planet. Talbot insists that he must face Thanos, but Taryan says he is nowhere near capable enough, but that there might be a way to strengthen him so he can face the [[Titans|Titan]].<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS520"/>

However, before they can make a decision, Maximoff notices a television in a shop behind Vision broadcasting the news of the [[Attack on Greenwich Village|attack on Greenwich village]] and the disappearance of [[Tony Stark]]. Turning to look, Vision recognizes that the aliens who attacked New York are the threat that the [[Mind Stone]] is warning him of.

Coulson tries to talk him down, warning of how dangerous the gravitonium is and that it could cause him to lose control, but Talbot accuses him of always doubting him and says he trusts the Confederacy member who told him about the deposit, revealing him to have been called "Kasius". Coulson pleads with Talbot to stop, explaining that the Kree ruling the remnants of humanity in the future was a [[Kasius]], and that Talbot is being played, but Talbot tells him he is in charge now and is Earth's last hope, forcing Coulson to kneel before him under threat of crushing him just like the [[Remorath]] he killed.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS520"/>

A [[Remorath]] then reports that an unseen object has breached their hull, and Talbot realizes it is S.H.I.E.L.D., using cloaking. He turns on Coulson, accusing him of contacting the team behind his back. When he asks General [[Hale]] if she had a part in it, Hale claims to have known that Coulson was making contact, and that she attempted to dissuade him.

May exclaims that they are here to save him, not attack, and Johnson tries to calm him down, but Talbot refuses to trust them. Hale speaks up for Johnson, however, saying that after the way she treated Ruby, she trusts her.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AoS520"/>
**<!--22:00-->Hale attempts to activate Talbot's [[HYDRA]] conditioning to stop him.

Fitz suggests that the 2091 Rodriguez's comment about the Earth's destruction came about from trying to save Coulson could be reframed with the assertion that if they do not just "try", but actually succeed, then perhaps that breaks the chain of events.

He tells her that while Creel had killed his friend, [[Isabelle Hartley]], once he had understood that Creel was not in his right mind and got to know the man, he had forgiven him and found him to be a good person.

She makes him swear, on his [[Meredith Quill|mother]], that he will kill her if the time comes, and Quill reluctantly, solemnly, eventually agrees. She kisses him, but they are interrupted by the sound of a crunch beside them. They turn and find [[Drax]], who informs them he has been standing there for an hour, claiming that he has mastered the ability of moving so slowly that he is invisible to the eye.

However, Johnson retorts by telling him that she knows his sons will die as cowards, and proceeds to use her force of will to wake herself up.

Strange agrees, but warns Stark that if he has to let him or Parker die to protect the Time Stone, he will.

He says that she, too, shared that will for a time, and that this was why he entrusted her with finding the [[Soul Stone]].

Playing it to her, Gamora sees that Thanos found a discussion between the sisters in which Gamora had told Nebula she secretly had found a map to the Soul Stone and burned it. Thanos demands that Gamora tell him where the stone is, and uses the [[Infinity Stones]] he has acquired to control Nebula's parts, forcing them to separate further and further and causing her agony until Gamora eventually gives in, unable to stand it any longer.

Mantis stops them to let them know that Doctor Strange is doing something odd, and they rush to help him as he levitates, using the [[Time Stone]] with his face flitting around uncontrollably.

*'''[[Sacrifice of Gamora]]''':
**Gamora and Thanos reach the top of the mountain, where a cloaked wraith-like figure greets them. He warns that the stone extracts a "terrible price". Thanos states that he is prepared, but the figures claims that everyone says that but goes on to find they are wrong, lowering himself to the ground and stepping into the light, revealing his face to them - [[Red Skull]], [[Captain America]]'s former enemy who, when he took hold of the [[Tesseract]] in [[1940s#1945|1945]], was sent by it to Vormir to stand guard of the Soul Stone.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AIW"/>

**Gamora begins to mock Thanos, believing he has finally failed, ultimately due to his lack of benevolence, as he loves no one. Thanos turns to her and begins to shed tears, which she believes to be because of his failure, but Red Skull informs her that he is not crying for himself. She comes to the horrified realization that Thanos might in fact genuinely care for her, and tries to tell him that surely his treatment of her could never have come from a place of love. He ignores her, knowing that his adoptive daughter truly is the one person in his life he had grown to love, and states that he has to persist nonetheless. She grabs her [[Gamora's Switchblade|switchblade]] and tries to kill herself first, but he uses the [[Reality Stone]] to turn it merely to bubbles, rendering it useless.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AIW"/>

Banner reminds the heroes that if they get through the dome at the back of the city, they will have direct access to [[Vision]], so T'Challa makes the reluctant decision to open a sliver of the barrier so that the aliens will take the easy route in and not go around the back. He shouts "Wakanda forever" to rally his forces and begins a charge, leading with Rogers as they take on the aliens. Battle breaks out, and T'Challa uses Kimoyo Beads to check in with [[Shuri]].

He explains that they are on the wreckage of his home planet, and uses the [[Reality Stone]] to show what it looked like before its ruin, showing its beauty. Thanos recounts, however, that like most planets it became unsustainable as there were too many people and not enough resources. He tells Strange how he offered the solution of random, dispassionate genocide of a portion of the population, but that they had called him mad, and then as he had predicted, the population all died out as a result. Thanos states that once he has all six [[Infinity Stones]] and snaps his fingers, he will make the hardest choice that others do not have the will to make and be mercifully saving the populations of planets across the universe by killing a random half.

[[Spider-Man]] webs his eyes to blind him and [[Drax the Destroyer]] slides at him to swipe with his [[Drax the Destroyer's Knives|knives]] at Thanos' legs. Strange opens a portal to attack Thanos from the other side, using a magic eldritch sword to assault him and forcing him to try to ward off enemies on both sides. He knocks Drax aside and pulls the webbing from his eyes, but Strange conjures magic platforms to allow [[Star-Lord]] to step up to Thanos' shoulder, placing a [[Gravity Mine]] on his back and then escaping through a portal Strange conjures. The mine detonates and Thanos is pulled to the ground, and Strange sends the [[Cloak of Levitation]] to wrap around Thanos' [[Infinity Gauntlet]] hand so he cannot close his fist - necessary to activate the Infinity Stones.<ref name="AoS 514-522/AMatW/AIW Placement"/><ref name="AIW"/>
