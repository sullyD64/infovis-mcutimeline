This is a timeline of events that occurred in the original 2091 before [[Glenn Talbot]] was killed by [[Quake]], preventing this future from coming to pass.

==2091==
===December===
====27th====
*<!--04:00-->74 years after being put in cryostasis, [[Leo Fitz]] is woken by [[Enoch]]. Enoch gives Fitz a helmet to disguise him as a [[Marauders|Marauder]] upon their arrival at the [[Lighthouse]], which Enoch says will be in a few days' time. He advises Fitz to prepare, as he will be facing some of the most ruthless and brutal monsters, mobsters, and mercenaries in the galaxy. Fitz insists that he has it in him to do so.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement">In ''[[Rewind (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Rewind]]'', it is said that the agents were transported to "Earth year 2-0-9-1". A scene dated to November 26, 2017 then shows "74 years later", which would specifically place the scene around late 2091.<br>In ''[[Missing Pieces]]'', Enoch says, "I was prepared to guard this vessel for the next 73 years, 261 days." This scene is implied to be after the events of ''[[The End]]'', firstly since it appeared in the episode after ''The End'', but mainly since the implication through the episode is that the attack on Fitz and Enoch's ship was an unfortunate side effect of changing time in ''The End''. However, ''The End'' is set no earlier than May 2018 (see [[2018]] references), but the very latest Fitz can arrive for all the dystopian future events of [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D./Season Five|Season 5]] to be in 2091 is December 27, 2091, if the day they return from is December 31st. So, the very latest that the scene can take place, 73 years and 261 days prior, is April 10, 2018. The assumption has to be made that the ship was always attacked, just in the dystopian universe they managed to get back onto a ship without Fitz having to be unthawed, while post-change of events in May 2018, in the continuing universe, the difference is that they failed to get back on track and Fitz was unthawed. The closer the attack can be to the May 2018 change of time, the better.<br>In ''[[Fear and Loathing on the Planet of Kitson]]'', when Enoch is asked where they are heading, he says, "Naro-Atzia. And from there, back to our solar system so we can orbit Jupiter for another 72 years, 312 days, after we purchase a cryo-chamber." With the episode unable to be set any earlier than June 2019 (see [[2019]] references), this would suggest that Fitz does not wake until Spring 2092, which is impossible. The assumption has to be made that Enoch intended for the ship to keep orbiting Jupiter for a while after, if they need to return to it or for whatever other reason. Still, the closer the 2091 events can be to Spring 2092, the better, so very late 2091 works best for both [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D./Season Six|Season 6]] comments.<br>So, the latest possible dates in 2091 are being used: December 27-31, 2091.</ref><ref name="AoS505">''[[Rewind (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D: 5.05: Rewind]]''</ref>

====29th====
*<!--09:46-->[[Phil Coulson]] quickly finds out they are in space and that time is frozen momentarily for everything but him. As soon as time restores, he questions a man named [[Virgil]], who claims to have known for years that [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] would come and save them.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS501"/>
*[[File:Virgil.png|thumb|250px|Virgil talks to Coulson]]He also explains the existence of [[Vrellnexians]] after his co-worker is suddenly dragged away by one. [[Alphonso Mackenzie]] arrives and impulsively knocks Virgil out, worried he is a threat.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS501"/>
*<!--10:00-->[[Yo-Yo Rodriguez]] and [[Jemma Simmons]], in a separate part of the station, investigate dead bodies they find with all their blood drained away. Coulson and Mackenzie find them and reunite, and together they speculate on what is happening.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS501"/>
*<!--10:00-->[[Deke Shaw]] floats into the space station from space, then turns on his artificial gravity, dropping to the floor.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS501"/>
*<!--10:05-->[[Melinda May]], as she arrives on the station, finds a tube stuck through her leg where she has appeared.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS501"/>
*<!--10:05-->Mackenzie, frustrated with everything that has been happening in quick succession, decides he wants to quit, to which Coulson objects. The group find an old postcard in Virgil's pocket as they tie him up and try to wake him.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS501"/>
[[File:Vrellnaxian pic.png|thumb|250px|A Vrellnexian]]
*<!--10:10-->[[Melinda May]] manages to bear the pain and escape from the tubing. She hears rattling and hides, fearing a threat.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS501"/>
*'''[[Escape from Level 3]]''':
**<!--10:10-->Virgil wakes back up and as the team questions him, he reveals he knows all of their identities as if they are celebrities, and hints that they have been taken to save humanity. As he promises that everything will make sense soon, he is suddenly killed by a Vrellnexian. The "roach" chases the group through the hallway until they are cornered, when [[Daisy Johnson]] finds her friends and quakes the roach apart.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS501"/>
**<!--10:12-->May watches Deke as he takes a disc from a corpse's arm. She engages him in a fight, which Deke wins, using a gravity manipulating device to make her float, and then gravitate to the wall.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS501"/>
**[[File:Orientation Part One 1.jpg|thumb|250px|Coulson and Johnson in the [[Lighthouse]]]]<!--10:15-->The rest of Coulson's team wonder how they got there - whether it is because of the Ghost Rider deal, that they are in the Framework, if magic transported them there, or something else. They decide to huddle together instead of splitting up as they investigate.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS501">''[[Orientation Part One|Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 5.01: Orientation Part One]]''</ref>
**<!--10:25-->Tied up by [[Deke Shaw]], [[Melinda May]] is helpless as he cuts into her arm to implant one of the discs, the same item he retrieved from the dead body: a "[[Metrics|metric]]".<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS501"/>
**<!--10:30-->[[Yo-Yo Rodriguez]] scouts ahead as the team roam the corridors of the space station. Meanwhile, [[Phil Coulson]] and [[Jemma Simmons]] discuss the station itself, with Coulson wondering if it were perhaps a [[Howard Stark]] project from the [[1980s]], and now, believing he is still in [[2017]], has been completed 3 decades later, but also musing that it does not feel right. Finding a computer, [[Daisy Johnson]] attempts to get it to work, but it shows a message saying "human access denied". Confused, the team scrutinize the other, alien language on the screens just as three [[Kree]] men enter. Mackenzie and Rodriguez attempt to fight back, but the aliens knock out the team with a concussive blast.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS501"/>
**<!--12:30-->Johnson wakes in a cell and sees Coulson and Simmons, but notices Mackenzie and Rodriguez's absence. She immediately asks the Kree guards where they are, but gets no response.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS501"/>
**[[File:Orientation_Part_One_11.jpg|thumb|250px|Deke leads the new recruits away from danger]]<!--12:40-->Meanwhile, Mackenzie and Rodriguez wake, realizing they have been hung up to be interrogated by the Kree.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS501"/>
**<!--12:40-->[[Deke Shaw]] arrives at Coulson, Johnson, and Simmons' cell with [[Melinda May]] and pretends to know them, whispering and using his eyes to communicate that he needs them to go along with his trick. He says that they were his friends and he had been looking for them, trying to convince the Kree that it is all just a mistake. The team inform him that Virgil has died, which he claims was what Virgil deserved, and, promising the Kree an hour or two in "the gallery", he eventually gets them to leave, letting Coulson's team go free.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS501"/>
**<!--12:45-->The Kree interrogating [[Alphonso Mackenzie]] and [[Yo-Yo Rodriguez]] begin freezing Rodriguez's hands at an extremely low temperature as a method of torture.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS501"/>
**<!--12:45-->Deke asks Coulson's team about what happened to Virgil, and the team confirm that roaches got him.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS501"/>
**[[File:Orientation P1 Trawler.jpeg|thumb|250px|The [[Trawler]]]]Deke claims that he only cares because Virgil owed him tokens, and tells the team his name. They hear Yo-Yo's screams from nearby, and May suddenly turns and switches his gravity manipulating device to pin him to the wall and get him to answer their questions urgently. He reluctantly directs them to the [[Trawler]] spacecraft, and Simmons and May leave to find it. Johnson leaves to save Mackenzie and Rodriguez, telling Coulson to stay behind and grill Deke for more answers.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS501"/>
**<!--12:50-->As [[Melinda May]] and [[Jemma Simmons]] descend in the elevator to Level 9, they look out of the window and see the scale of the Kree's operation. Together, they come to the realization that the Kree are planning an invasion, believing that they want to conquer Earth. The duo find the Trawler and board the craft.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS501"/>
**[[File:Kree Symbol2.png|thumb|250px|The Kree]]<!--12:50-->Johnson looks for Rodriguez as the Kree continue to torture her, telling her that any time soon, her arms will snap off.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS501"/>
**<!--12:53-->[[Phil Coulson]] questions [[Deke Shaw]] about the Kree's potential attack on humanity.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS501"/>
**<!--12:50-->[[Daisy Johnson]] finds [[Alphonso Mackenzie]] and [[Yo-Yo Rodriguez]], giving them the support they need to be able to retaliate. Rodriguez kicks one of the Kree and a fight begins.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS501"/>
*<!--12:53-->[[Jemma Simmons]] finds the key to the Trawler and her and [[Melinda May]] begin flying the ship.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS501"/>
*<!--12:53-->Deke is confused by Coulson's questions, not understanding why he does not know the answers, as the history of the [[Lighthouse]] and the [[Kree]]'s operations are common knowledge among the humans.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS501"/>
*<!--12:53-->Mackenzie and Rodriguez fight against their captors and are freed from their chains with Johnson's help. Mackenzie and Johnson each kill one of the Kree, and then attempt to contact the Trawler.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS501"/>
[[File:May pilots the Trawler.png|thumb|250px|Simmons and May in the Trawler]]
*<!--12:58-->As they fly in the Trawler, Simmons looks out and recognizes the constellations, working out that they are still in the {{WPS|Milky Way}}.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS501"/>
*<!--12:58-->Deke informs Coulson that the Lighthouse is over 90 years old.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS501"/>
*<!--12:58-->Johnson uses a computer to try to find their location, but is confused when she is given longitude and latitude coordinates. As an idea dawns on Mackenzie, he withdraws Virgil's postcard from his pocket to have a closer look.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS501"/>
*<!--12:59-->As Deke speaks with Coulson, he realizes that Virgil might have been right about the agents coming from the past.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS501"/>
*[[File:Orientation Part One 16.jpg|thumb|250px|Coulson argues with Deke Shaw]]Asking what year Coulson came from, Coulson discerns his meaning, understanding that the [[White Monolith]] was different to the [[Monolith|Maveth one]] - it transported them not just through space, but through time, into the future.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS501"/>
*<!--12:59-->As Simmons realizes that she in fact recognizes all the constellations around them, May gets her attention, showing her that there is a school bus floating among the debris in front of them. The truth of their location dawns on them.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS501"/>
*<!--12:59-->Mackenzie shows Johnson the back of the old postcard, and the message it carries, "Working on it - Fitz". They are shocked as they comprehend its significance: [[2017]] was decades ago.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS501"/>
*<!--13:00-->Simmons comes to terms with their predicament as she looks out at the destroyed planet, sadly uttering, "No reason to send a message back to Earth... We're already here."<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS501"/>
*<!--13:05-->Before Simmons and May can further react, the [[Trawler]] is hit by debris. Simmons is forced to turn it off for a few seconds before rebooting, but manages to get it working again to return to the [[Lighthouse]].<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS502"/>
*<!--13:35-->[[Jemma Simmons]] and [[Melinda May]] get back to the Lighthouse, where they are reunited with [[Phil Coulson]] and [[Deke Shaw]]. The group is later met by [[Tess]], a friend of [[Virgil]], who had been told about the supposed [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents coming in the future by Virgil. Coulson proves that he is from the past by taking out a [[2016]] coin, showing that it is shiny from being newly minted only the year before when he had been taken from. Tess then remains with the half of the team, while Shaw goes to find [[Quake]], [[Alphonso Mackenzie]], and [[Yo-Yo Rodriguez]].<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS502"/>
*<!--13:40-->[[Deke Shaw]] finds Mackenzie, Rodriguez, and Johnson, only to discover that they have killed two [[Kree]] guards, much to his horror, worried that they could be discovered and targeted for their attack. He helps them to hide the bodies.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS502"/>
*<!--13:45-->Tess explains to the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents what happened: [[Earth]] was destroyed by a cataclysmic event and the Kree had arrived shortly after, taking over the Lighthouse in which the survivors had gathered. She mentions that some of the elders had talked about how [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] would come to save them from the past, but that the Kree had killed them all, so she had only ever heard the stories from Virgil - the only person she ever knew to believe. Coulson asks [[Tess]] to take him to Virgil's room, hoping to find some answers, and she agrees.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS502"/>
*<!--13:50-->Shaw, Mackenzie, Rodriguez and Johnson continue getting rid of the bodies. Wanting to transfer them to upstairs but not wanting to get caught in the elevator with the corpses, they throw the bodies onto the roof of the elevator before getting into it.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS502"/>
*<!--13:55-->Tess asks about the dangers of Earth in the 2010s, mentioning having heard of tornadoes of sharks, but Coulson explains to her that the "Sharknado" was fiction, from a movie. As they continue on their way to Virgil's room, they encounter [[Holt]] and [[Grill]], two members of the [[Lighthouse]], arguing. Before they can escape, however, Grill calls out to Tess, asking about the Trawler. She informs him that Virgil is dead, and explains that Coulson is a new pilot she is training.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS502"/>
*<!--14:05-->Arriving upstairs, the group drag the Kree bodies to dispose of them. Deke begins to attempt to flirt with [[Daisy Johnson]], but fails.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS502"/>
*<!--14:20-->Getting to [[Virgil]]'s room, Coulson finds several [[Earth]] artifacts. Tess informs him that Earth will not be habitable again, but also that Virgil kept a small globe in hope that the Earth would come back together, and that while everyone thought he was talking nonsense, since he had been right about the agents, maybe it was not so ludicrous after all. Coulson then discovers Virgil's diary, containing diagrams. Noting that it was important enough for Virgil to hide, he wonders whether it might be helpful.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS502"/>
*<!--14:20-->Meanwhile, May and Simmons attend a food distribution. They discuss [[Leo Fitz]], who Simmons realizes might now, by 2091, have lived his whole life without her. A fight breaks out between two of the human survivors over food and one of them, [[Reese (Lighthouse)|Reese]], is wounded. Simmons tends to his wound with May's assistance, but [[Sinara]], the leader of the [[Kree Watch]] who were supervising the place, intervenes and orders her to be taken away.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS502"/>
*<!--15:40-->May informs Coulson and Tess about what happened to Simmons. The rest of the agents then arrive, and [[Deke Shaw]] and [[Tess]] step aside to discuss Simmons' actions, with Shaw worriedly mentioning that the agents could endanger everything he and the others have done to survive. Alphonso Mackenzie tells Yo-Yo Rodriguez that she should refrain from using her powers to help Simmons, because it is important to keep her powers secret from everyone at the Lighthouse. Thinking that he may know where Simmons is being kept, Johnson then decides that she will follow Shaw when he leaves, and splits from the group to go after him as he walks away.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS502"/>
*<!--15:40-->Simmons is taken to lower levels of the Lighthouse and is ordered to undress and clean herself.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS502"/>
*<!--16:20-->Sinara takes Simmons to be brought before [[Kasius]], the Lighthouse's ruler - a noble Kree man.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS502"/>
*<!--16:25-->Johnson follows Shaw back to his personal area in the Lighthouse, but when she enters a secret room he has disappeared into, she suddenly finds herself becoming drowsy and passes out. When she wakes, she is stunned to find herself in an environment that appears to be a street, outside a bar, in the 2010s. Her immediate assumption is that she is back in the [[Framework]]. She then spots Deke Shaw walking into the nearby bar, and goes to speak with him.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS502">''[[Orientation Part Two|Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 5.02: Orientation Part Two]]''</ref>
*<!--16:25-->Kasius interrogates Simmons about what happened during the food distribution, and how she acquired the medical skills she displayed. As he speaks to her, however, he is fascinated when he notices that she does not have a [[Metrics|metric]] in her arm, nor even a scar where it would have been.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS502"/>
*<!--16:30-->Coulson and the other agents manage to steal a Kree tablet, hoping it will contain valuable information, but then notice that people are gathering in the corridors under Kree supervision. Worried that having no [[metrics]] could get then exposed, Coulson goes over to [[Grill]] and asks him to implant the devices on them in exchange for the tablet. He says that the fact that they managed to steal it makes them valuable, and offers them the chance to work for him.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS502"/>
*<!--16:35-->Johnson goes to speak to Shaw, who explains that he has used old technology, which Johnson informs him was known as the Framework, to generate visions of what the Earth looked like in the past, selling the experience to people who want to feel comforted by it. Johnson claims that the experience he is selling people is only trading the prison of the Lighthouse for the prison of the Framework, but Shaw explains that the Framework is easily the better option, as the Lighthouse is far worse than a prison.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS502"/>
*'''[[Renewal]]''':
**<!--16:35-->[[Sinara]] arrives along with the rest of the [[Kree Watch]], activating some people's [[metrics]]. Tess sees this and informs May that the event is a [[Renewal]], where some low-earners are picked and left one gun, then forced to the death.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS502"/>
**<!--16:40-->Meanwhile, Coulson, Rodriguez and Mackenzie are given their metrics from [[Grill]].<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS502"/>
**<!--16:40-->Chaos breaks out in the Lighthouse as the residents fight to survive.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS502"/>
**<!--16:40-->In order to save his life, as his metric had turned red to indicate that he needs to partake in the Renewal, Grill magnetizes the agents' metrics to stick them to the wall, leaving them out as he goes to hide, for the other residents to kill them rather than him.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS502"/>
**<!--16:45-->[[Holt]] comes after Grill but finds the agents first, threatening to kill them to satisfy the life debt the Kree Watch are wanting paid. However, [[Melinda May]] then arrives and defends them from Holt. A battle ensues between her and the man, but it is ended when Holt is killed by [[Tess]], shooting from the side of the room, and explaining that while she did not want to kill him, someone had to die to end the Renewal. The [[Kree]] arrive and use their tablet to check the living and the dead, but find the agents' metrics unregistered - however, Grill steps in and pledges for them, knowing that he needs them around so he can put them to use.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS502"/>
*<!--16:45-->[[Reese]], the man that Simmons saved, is brought to Kasius and Simmons. Kasius cannot help but notice that his wounds, even if well treated, will permanently be visible, especially the one in his forehead. Deciding that he cannot have a servant who is imperfect, Kasius then has Sinara kill Reese, to Simmons' horror. He then extracts a mysterious viscous fluid from Reese's ear and injects it into Simmons' instead, making her deaf except to his voice. He recruits Simmons as his new servant.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS502"/>
*<!--16:50-->[[Deke Shaw]] talks to [[Daisy Johnson]] about his operation in the [[Framework]], telling her that he is using the environment to learn more about the 2010s, and thus help him in trying to find some answers about the [[Destruction of Earth|destruction of Earth]]. He then notices a [[WHiH World News]] report playing on the virtual bar's television from [[2017|April 12, 2017]],<ref name="AoS408">''[[The Laws of Inferno Dynamics|Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 4.08: The Laws of Inferno Dynamics]]''</ref> reporting on Quake saving lives in [[Los Angeles]], and recognizes the "Quake" name as the woman who destroyed the planet. The news then shows footage of Quake, and Shaw comes to the realization that Quake and Johnson are one and the same, turning to her and informing her,to her horror, that she was the one who tore the apart.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS502"/>
*<!--17:55-->[[Kasius]] addresses [[Jemma Simmons]], his new servant, telling her that she must do everything he demands. He tells her to prepare for the arrival of visitors he has invited.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS502"/>
*<!--18:15-->[[Kasius]] and his servants, now including [[Jemma Simmons]], believe that they are going to be receiving Lady [[Basha]] as a guest, but an envoy arrives in her stead. Kasius is informed that Lady Basha will not attend the meal, but that she is looking forward to the ceremony he is holding. When the envoy leaves, Kasius speaks with a servant called [[Tye]], asking if there is any good news on the ceremony preparations, but Tye reports that there is no progress, and Kasius has an outburst of anger. [[Sinara]] calms him down, and he goes to Simmons, telling her that she must solve a problem for him.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS503"/>
*<!--18:15-->[[Grill]] hurries all of his workers with their respective jobs, now with [[Phil Coulson]], [[Alphonso Mackenzie]], and [[Yo-Yo Rodriguez]] among them. [[Zev]], who works for Grill, gives Rodriguez an electric shock through her metric to work faster, and Mackenzie decides to try to defend her. He goes after Grill, but Grill magnetizes his metric to stick his arm to the wall, reminding Mackenzie that he belongs to him now.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS503"/>
*<!--18:15-->[[Daisy Johnson]] and [[Deke Shaw]], now conscious again and out of the [[Framework]], look to find Johnson's friends, but Johnson becomes agitated when they have no luck. Shaw insists that she is deflecting after finding out that she cracked the [[Earth]] apart, but she insists that she could not have done it, not having enough power. He raises the scientific [[Multiverse]] Theory, that perhaps she has merely come from a reality where she had not yet destroyed the planet, but that this does not negate the fact that she is the one to do it. She slaps him for his persistent insistence that she is guilty. Soon, Shaw realizes that there has been a [[Renewal]], and tells Johnson that her friends might be hiding, suggesting that she should start by looking at Grill's place of work.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS503"/>
*<!--18:20-->Alphonso Mackenzie tells the others that he did not just go after Grill out of spite, but in fact to survey Grill's office, working out where he is keeping the tablet. He suggests to Rodriguez that she use her powers to recover the tablet, with the hope that it could get them access to Simmons' level. [[Melinda May]] and [[Tess]] return from a flight in the [[Trawler]], and when Coulson lets her know he needs to come with her, Tess manages to convince Grill to let Coulson and Mackenzie join for the next mission.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS503"/>
*<!--18:30-->[[Jemma Simmons]] is taken to a room where she is ordered to help a young [[Inhumans|Inhuman]], [[Abby]], to master her newly acquired powers. Abby, who is suffering frequent seizures, reveals that she recently underwent Terrigenesis, and that she is scared of what might happen if she is not ready for Kasius' ceremony.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS503"/>
*<!--18:30-->[[Daisy Johnson]] finds the team and hides behind a wall as Rodriguez updates her on what has happened. She tells her that they will attempt to recover the Kree tablet and Johnson suggests that she then take it to go to save Simmons. Grill sends Zev to accompany Tess, Coulson, May, and Mackenzie, saying that he is suspicious of them and wants him to find out what they are up to.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS503"/>
*<!--18:35-->Tess finds her friend [[Flint]] resting near the Trawler and gets him to leave. [[Phil Coulson]] then tells the others that from [[Virgil]]'s diary, he thinks that he had been doing reconnaissance on Earth's surface, commenting that Virgil repeatedly wrote about section "616" of the broken planet. Tess says that 616 is only barren rock, but Coulson speculates that Virgil might have hidden something there, and while she is reluctant to come with them to investigate as Grill is already unhappy with her, she eventually agrees when Coulson highlights that this mission could find what Virgil died for. As they go to board the Trawler, [[Zev]] arrives and tells them that he does not trust them, informing them, to their dismay, that he is coming along.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS503"/>
*<!--18:45-->Simmons manages to calm [[Abby]] down, talking to her about the upcoming ceremony. She explains that she has to demonstrate her powers to get to go off-planet and travel the galaxy as an ambassador, but that if she does not, she is concerned because [[Tye]] told her that her family will be punished in response. Simmons gets her to tell her about her abilities, and Simmons recognizes the description as the power to control her own molecular density. Abby says that she cannot master it and begins to panic again, but Simmons reassures her that she will help.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS503"/>
*<!--19:00-->Coulson tells May that with Grill and Zev's suspicions, this may be their last chance to investigate. May wonders if they might find something to help them return to [[2017]], but Coulson admits that he is not getting his hopes up. May says, however, that having endured the [[Framework]] for weeks, she feels she has earned at least one peaceful night at home.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS503"/><ref name="AoS503"/>
*<!--19:15-->Rodriguez uses her powers to run around the workshop, making [[Grill]] believe that her metric is broken so that he comes to her and removes it momentarily. In that moment free of surveillance, she uses her powers to run to his office and take the Kree scroll, give it to [[Daisy Johnson]], and return to her point of origin. Grill installs a new metric, not realizing anything has happened.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS503"/>
*<!--19:30-->In the [[Trawler]], Tess informs Coulson and May that Zev has not yet noticed their detour. She takes out [[Virgil]]'s miniature globe from her pocket, saying he always carried it when they went on a Trawler run and wondering if he was superstitious. [[Phil Coulson]] suspects, however, that it might be something more, and he opens up the globe to discover a small tool, which Tess recognizes as the missing knob to open a locker inside the Trawler. They open it to find a radio, realizing that Virgil was using a radio to communicate with someone, but before they can investigate further, they are caught by Zev. The man magnetizes their metrics, except for May since she is piloting, but May uses the opportunity of all the others being secured to the wall to crash the Trawler into a rock and cause turbulence, making Zev fall over. Mackenzie takes advantage of this and knocks Zev out, but Tess is dismayed, worried that they will get killed for attacking a superior.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS503"/>
*<!--19:30-->Under Simmons' guidance, Abby makes encouraging progress with her powers, temporarily phasing her hand through a pitcher. However, before they can work further, Kasius comes back and takes Abby for the ceremony to demonstrate her powers before Lady [[Basha]]. Kasius asks Sinara why she thinks Simmons was successful in helping the girl, and Sinara replies disgustedly that it is because of Simmons' "compassion".<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS503">''[[A Life Spent|Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 5.03: A Life Spent]]''</ref>
*<!--19:35-->[[Deke Shaw]] reunites with [[Daisy Johnson]], who wants to break into the lower levels to rescue Simmons. He tries to convince her to make a safer, long-term plan and not go in blind, but she insists on acting as soon as possible. He claims that she is endangering everyone because if the [[Kree]] find out, they might start a Renewal for many more lives in retaliation, but she claims that this danger is the very reason she needs to save Simmons as soon as possible, quaking him out of her way. He spitefully calls her "Quake, the Destroyer of Worlds", which she tells him to never call her again.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS503"/>
*<!--19:37-->The [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] team on-board the [[Trawler]] set up Virgil's radio and eventually receive a transmission. They initially think it is coming from section 616, but then realize that it is merely reflecting off the rock, and the signal's origin is in fact on the surface of the destroyed [[Earth]].<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS503"/>
*<!--20:00-->Kasius receives Lady Basha, and they and everyone else present walk to the ceremonial arena. [[Abby]] is taken out in front of one of Basha's fighters, the [[Beast]], to prove her worth, and a fight begins. The Beast begins to easily best her, tossing her across the arena and slamming her into a wall.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS503"/>
*<!--20:05-->Daisy Johnson proceeds with her plan to rescue [[Jemma Simmons]], getting to a lower level of the Lighthouse.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS503"/>
*<!--20:05-->'''[[Inhuman Trial Ceremony]]''': Abby continues to be overpowered and violently beaten by Basha's ferocious warrior. He turns to Basha for approval to kill Abby, which she agrees upon, but after exchanging looks with Simmons, Abby remembers her advice and finally masters her powers, becoming dense to resist the Beast's attacks, then accidentally phasing through his chest in self-defense, killing him as her arm densifies again. Simmons is glad that Abby has survived, but horrified that she has had to kill to do it.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS503"/>
*<!--20:05-->Tess and the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents begin to argue, as Tess thinks that they have to kill Zev and make it sound like an accident if they are going to have any chance of surviving their return to the [[Lighthouse]]. Zev finds the fuel line where they have locked him up and cuts it, forcing the group to head back to the Lighthouse.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS503"/>
*<!--20:25-->Thrilled by her performance in the ceremony, Lady Basha decides to buy Abby at a high price. Simmons is dismayed, however, knowing that the sale is not the dream Abby had thought it would be but will instead be to make her Basha's personal warrior.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS503"/>
*<!--20:25-->[[Daisy Johnson]] accesses the next elevator to get her to Simmons' level. Two [[Kree]] enter and she quickly uses her powers to fly up to the ceiling and hide. She slips, however, alerting them to her presence, and is forced to fight them both, eventually winning by knocking them out. She then realizes, however, that the elevator button has been broken during the skirmish.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS503"/>
*<!--20:40-->Back at the [[Lighthouse]], [[Grill]] accuses Coulson and the rest of mutiny, picking up where [[Virgil]] left off. [[Tess]] speaks up to tell Grill that it was just her who mutinied, pointing out that the others did not even know Virgil. [[Yo-Yo Rodriguez]] uses her powers to place a gun on [[Zev]] and then tells Grill that his henchman is carrying an illegal weapon, claiming he threatened her with it. Grill checks Zev and sees that Rodriguez was right, so he begins electrocuting him through his metric and the group use the opportunity to claim that they had only lied because they were worried if they accused Zev then the Kree will find out and come after Grill. Grill tells them that for this reason, he himself will hand over Zev as a traitor so they receive no blowback.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS503"/>
*<!--20:40-->'''[[Capture of Quake]]''': As she arrives on Simmons' level, Johnson is suddenly trapped as glass walls fall from the ceiling on either side of her and gas is used to sedate her. [[Kasius]] arrives with [[Deke Shaw]], who tipped him off about the attack and tells the Kree that Quake is a weapon of mass destruction. Kasius is intrigued as to how the Destroyer of Worlds is there, but Shaw says the important thing is that she is now his. Johnson tells Shaw she will kill him, but Shaw says he is simply playing the long game that she refused to play herself.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS503"/>

====30th====
*<!--03:00-->[[Phil Coulson]] wakes, having taken his shift among the group to get some sleep. He looks out of his window briefly, admiring space, then tells himself to get back to work and leaves.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS422">''[[World's End|Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 4.22: World's End]]''</ref><ref name="AoS503"/>
*<!--03:00-->Coulson rejoins his team, who have been working on improving [[Virgil]]'s radio. They eventually manage to receive the incoming transmission more clearly and find that the people behind it have been leaving messages for Virgil asking if he has secured the "delegation". The agents realize this is referring to them, and that this must mean whoever is on the surface knows who they are and why they are here. Coulson says he wants to investigate, but Tess insists that this is impossible, as the surface is where people are sent to die.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS503"/>
*<!--03:00-->Zev is left on the surface of the Earth, having been punished by the Kree. He tries to find somewhere safe, but is quickly devoured by [[Vrellnexians]].<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS503"/>
*<!--09:30-->After capturing [[Quake]], [[Kasius]] interrogates her to ascertain whether she has allies within the [[Lighthouse]]. He tells her of his intent to put her on auction, and threatens to torture [[Jemma Simmons]] if she does not cooperate.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS504"/>
*<!--09:55-->In salvage, [[Phil Coulson]], [[Melinda May]], [[Alphonso Mackenzie]], and [[Yo-Yo Rodriguez]] continue to work for [[Grill]] and try to figure out what to do about the fact that Johnson never returned. Grill interrupts them and orders Mackenzie to steal a package intended a man called [[Gunner (Lighthouse)|Gunner]] is expecting from the technologically advanced Level 35, to pressure Gunner into repaying a debt he owes.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS504"/>
*<!--09:55-->Quake is taken to a room where [[Inhumans]] are training, waiting to demonstrate their powers for Kasius and potential buyers. She meets an Inhuman called [[Ben]], who is capable of reading other people's minds. The Inhumans are taken away, but [[Tye]] orders her to stay.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS504"/>
*<!--10:00-->Coulson advises Mackenzie to comply with Grill's orders and go with Rodriguez, and notes that this gives them an opportunity to access Level 35, where they might find technology to help them survive the surface of the [[Earth]].<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS504"/>
*<!--10:00-->Tye orders Johnson to demonstrate her powers for Lady [[Basha]], and she does so by attacking him. He turns on a blocker for her powers, but the demonstration is sufficient for Basha to offer to purchase Quake. She immediately makes an offer, but Kasius revels in denying her request, insisting on discussing Quake's price over dinner, which he notes she has rudely consistently avoided. She leaves, angered, and Kasius turns to [[Deke Shaw]], rewarding him with a rhodium token. He orders Shaw to look for other people who might have come from the past.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS504"/>
*<!--10:10-->Johnson finds Ben, and he informs her that the Inhumans are forced to fight against each other, explaining that their families' lives are threatened to motivate them.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS504"/>
*<!--12:00-->Coulson and May find Deke Shaw and ask him about Johnson's whereabouts, and he tells them that she decided to go dark until she found Simmons. They then inform him of their intent to explore the surface of the Earth, and play the radio message they got thanks to [[Virgil]], which surprises Shaw, having believed everyone on the surface to be dead.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS504"/>
*<!--12:25-->Mackenzie explains to Rodriguez that he is concerned about them losing their morality in the harshness of their environment, considering Rodriguez had already caused [[Zev]]'s death. She tells him that sometimes they need to make hard decisions to cause the least harm to good people, and promises that they will not lose themselves.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS504"/>
*<!--12:25-->Quake and Simmons are taken before Kasius, who also brings in [[Ben]] and orders the women to tell the truth about who else they came with, knowing Ben can use his powers to expose them if they are lying. Nonetheless, the women continue to nervously lie and say they came alone, but are surprised and relieved when Ben decides to cover for them, telling Kasius they are telling the truth. Kasius then instructs Quake to tell her story in detail, using the deafening device in Simmons' ear so she cannot hear and placing himself between her and Quake so she cannot lipread, hoping to test the women's stories separately and see if they align. Quake persists with the lie anyway and tells a fake story to protect her friends, then Kasius turns and asks Simmons to tell her version. Quake is delighted yet bewildered when Simmons recounts an exactly matching story, and realizes Ben must somehow have helped. Kasius remains suspicious, but sends them away.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS504">''[[A Life Earned|Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 5.04: A Life Earned]]''</ref>
*<!--12:30-->Shaw takes Coulson and May to Level 36, as Level 35 is restricted, then uses his [[Gravity Puck]] to levitate out of the elevator to the level above and call the elevator from Level 35 itself, allowing the agents access.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS504"/>
*<!--12:35-->After the interrogation, Johnson asks Ben what happened, and he reveals that the [[Kree]] do not know that he can not only read thoughts, but also relay his own thoughts to other people's minds, explaining that he relayed her story to Simmons mentally. Ben also tells her that being brought before Kasius allowed him an opportunity to read his mind, and that he discovered that the Kree nobleman intends on destroying the Lighthouse soon.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS504"/>
*<!--12:35-->[[Yo-Yo Rodriguez]] and [[Alphonso Mackenzie]] approach [[Gunner (Lighthouse)|Gunner]], and Rodriguez starts to threaten him on [[Grill]]'s behalf.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS504"/>
*<!--12:35-->Coulson, May, and Shaw roam Level 35.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS504"/>
*<!--12:36-->Meanwhile, Mackenzie and Rodriguez keep pressing Gunner, and Mackenzie tells him that if he does not comply, they can seize the package he is expecting.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS504"/>
*<!--12:36-->Coulson, May, and Shaw enter a mysterious room on Level 35 and discover that it is some sort of laboratory.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS504"/>
*<!--12:36-->Gunner becomes very defensive of the package he is due to receive, angrily saying that he will kill them if they take it.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS504"/>
*<!--12:37-->In the laboratory, Coulson, May, and Shaw are surprised to find a [[Humans|human]] baby, and realize that it is the package due to go to Gunner, not advanced technology as Grill had believed.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS504"/>
*<!--12:37-->Rodriguez soon notices that Gunner has been carrying baby toys, and realizes the true nature of the package. She informs Mackenzie and he ashamedly apologizes, but Gunner continues to angrily snap at him, telling him that violent people like him are the reason children are scarce, and that he does not deserve a child himself. This hits a nerve with Mackenzie, who is still upset about losing Hope twice, and he loses his cool, attacking Gunner. Rodriguez stops him and the agents leave.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS504"/>
*<!--12:40-->[[Deke Shaw]] explains to [[Phil Coulson]] that people can no longer become pregnant, as the Kree have sterilized humans seemingly through the food supply. He says that Kasius is artificially growing the humans to increase the chances of them being [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] as this makes them more valuable for sale, to Coulson's disgust. May, meanwhile, discovers that the lab's files have a sample of Johnson's DNA from capturing her yesterday, revealing Deke's duplicity, having claimed to see her that morning. She punches Shaw in the face and confronts him, but before he can explain, two Kree guards arrive and a fight breaks out. They defeat the guards, but Deke is wounded in the process. May sends Coulson upstairs with Shaw to question him, saying she will stay to fight the further oncoming guards.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS504"/>
*<!--12:45-->Coulson reluctantly leaves May, and she prepares for the arrival of Kree guards, but instead finds that the attacker is [[Sinara]]. Still suffering from her leg wound, May cannot withstand Sinara's assaults, who advances to the verge of making a kill, but then decides instead to only capture the agent.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS504"/>
*<!--12:55-->Coulson tends to Shaw's wound and interrogates him. Shaw says he did what he needed to to help Johnson and everyone else, butt Coulson accuses Shaw of only acting out of greed for rewards, saying that he suspects he only wants to get to the surface to hand over the people living there. Shaw tells the story of how his parents rebelled against the Kree, and that he thought that his father had been devoured by [[Vrellnexians]] until Coulson played him the the radio message, revealing that he had been shocked to recognize his father's voice. Shaw explains that this is his reason for wanting to visit the surface, but Coulson is still hesitant to trust him, ordering Deke to hand over his rhodium token reward to prove he did not act out of selfishness. He reluctantly does so, but Coulson still chooses to lock him up for their safety. He reunites with [[Yo-Yo Rodriguez]], who tells him that she has not heard from May.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS504"/>
*<!--15:00-->The agents secretly deliver the token taken from Shaw to [[Gunner (Lighthouse)|Gunner]], so that he can repay his debt and it can help him raise his baby.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS504"/>
*<!--15:00-->Rodriguez talks to Mackenzie about his angry outburst, which he feels ashamed of. He tells her that he is struggling more with the loss of the [[Hope Mackenzie (Framework)|virtual Hope]] than he did for [[Hope Mackenzie|his real daughter]], and that this makes him worry that Gunner was right - that he is indeed a terrible father. Rodriguez assures her that even if Hope was not real, his love for her was, and that is what matters and what makes him a great parent. Grill then arrives and thanks Mackenzie, saying that Gunner has repaid him.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS504"/>
*<!--17:00-->Kasius prepares to open an exhibition of Inhuman powers, with Quake being the highlight of the show. However, before the show is open, a marauder potential buyer steps forward with a request that Quake should not be exhibited, but rather should fight to the death. He pulls off his marauder helmet, and Johnson is shocked to see that the man is [[Leo Fitz]], not understanding how he has traveled from [[2017]].<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS504"/>
*[[Flint]] goes about his day in the Lighthouse. Things seem normal until he finds Kree roaming the level. He panics, but before he can do anything, a Kree reaper takes him.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS506"/>
*<!--18:00-->[[Tess]] finds [[Phil Coulson]], [[Alphonso Mackenzie]] and [[Yo-Yo Rodriguez]] and informs them that the [[Kree]] have gathered teenagers to harvest in a [[Terrigenesis]] ceremony.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS506"/>
*<!--18:00-->In the lower levels of the [[Lighthouse]], [[Enoch]] informs Fitz about several of the bidders who have come to purchase [[Inhumans]] and tells him he has to pose as "Boshtok", a highly dangerous and rich [[Marauders|marauder]]. As they talk, Fitz suddenly notices [[Jemma Simmons]] entering the room.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS506"/>
*[[Kasius]] watches on and speaks to [[Sinara]]. She gives "Boshtok" a suspicious look, and he tells her that he, too, is not sure about the marauder, not recognizing him. He says he will keep an eye on the man.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS506"/>
*<!--18:15-->Fitz approaches Simmons from behind as she goes about serving duties, asking her to stay facing forward so as not to arouse suspicion. He professes his love for her, stating that despite the universe's attempts to keep them apart, their love is more powerful than everything else. He proposes to her, but she still does not show any signs of recognition. [[Kasius]] arrives and Simmons turns around, stunned to see Fitz but trying to contain her reaction so as not to give him away. Kasius explains that the servants can only hear him, and Fitz reprimands him, saying they cannot serve the guests if they cannot hear them. Kasius reluctantly allows Simmons to hear again.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS506"/>
*<!--18:15-->[[Tess]] explains to [[Phil Coulson]] and the others that every year, Kasius makes 18-year-olds undergo [[Terrigenesis]] in order to create new [[Inhumans]] to sell, except that the last "misting" was only months ago, and that some of the young people being collected at the moment are under 18. She also points out that her friend Flint is among the collected.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS506"/>
*<!--20:00-->At the Terrigenesis ceremony, [[Flint]] is the only one to be encrusted in a Terrigenesis husk, having the Terrigen gene. However, when it shatters, the observers find that Flint has vanished; unbeknown to them, [[Yo-Yo Rodriguez]] used her super-speed to rush him to safety in salvage and protect him from being sold to bidders.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS506"/>
*<!--20:00-->Kasius and all the bidders, including Fitz, meet for dinner with the slave Inhumans standing around. [[Daisy Johnson]] apologizes to [[Ben]] for having involved him in her fight, as they watch the bidders dine. During the dinner, another bidder, [[Gaius Ponarian]] delivers [[Xandarian Snails|Xandarian Snail]] to the table. Fitz manages to gain Kasius' favour by antagonizing Ponarian, showing the others his hardiness. Kasius then leads the bidders to the arena, as Fitz notices that Simmons has stolen a knife.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS506"/>
*<!--20:05-->The [[Kree Watch]] members wonder where Flint has gone.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS506"/>
*<!--20:10-->Rodriguez and Flint are joined by [[Tess]], Coulson, and Mackenzie. The group tell Flint that they will help hide him from the Kree, as if he is sold, his life will be even worse.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS506"/>
*<!--20:20-->At the arena, [[Ben]] is ordered to fight [[Melinda May]], who has been captured by [[Sinara]]. Fitz continues to converse with Kasius, discussing their troubles with their respective fathers. May and Ben duel, and Ben starts to win, reading her mind to anticipate her attacks. May manages to get some hits in by attacking instinctively without prior thought, but she struggles due to her leg injury, and Ben eventually kicks her to the ground. Fitz steps in to save May, claiming the fight is boring and advising Kasius to send her to the surface of the [[Earth]] to feed the [[Vrellnexians]]. Kasius does so, to Fitz's relief, hoping it will give her an opportunity to escape. Ben, however, tells her that her death has simply been delayed.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS506">''[[Fun & Games|Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 5.06: Fun & Games]]''</ref>
*<!--20:40-->Tess leaves the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents and is found by [[Vicar]], the Kree responsible for organising the [[Terrigenesis]] ceremonies, who interrogates her to see whether she know where Flint is. She replies that she does not know and that Flint was just a business partner, then leaves, but Vicar remains suspicious.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS506"/>
*<!--21:00-->Rodriguez tells Flint about her own Terrigenesis and how she had trouble controlling her powers. However, [[Grill]], who has been eavesdropping, reveals his presence and activates their [[metrics]], telling them he intends to deliver Rodriguez and Flint to Kasius.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS506"/>
*<!--21:00-->After the fight, the bidders gather for Ben's auction. However, Kasius reveals that he in discovering Melinda May, he has realized that Ben lied to him to protect Johnson and Simmons. He has [[Sinara]] execute Ben.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS506"/>
*<!--21:05-->The [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents try to convince Grill to not hand them over to the [[Kree]], but Grill refuses to listen to them. Without realizing, in his anxious state, Flint's powers start to activate - telekinetically moving rocks on the floor.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS506"/>
*<!--21:10-->Simmons and Johnson meet and plan to work with Fitz to escape from Kasius, taking advantage of when Johnson's inhibitor is turned off by Kasius for her fight.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS506"/>
*<!--21:10-->Fitz and Simmons almost reunite properly when they find each other in a corridor, but another servant arrives and tells Simmons that something require their attention, taking her away. [[Enoch]] arrives and informs Fitz that Kasius' own brother, [[Faulnak]], has arrived for the demonstration.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS506"/>
*<!--21:10-->With [[Yo-Yo Rodriguez]]'s encouragement, [[Flint]] ultimately controls his power of geokinesis. He uses it to combine small stones to assemble a massive rock, which he then throws at Grill. The attack stops their oppressor, but accidentally kills the man.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS506"/>
*<!--21:20-->Fitz asks [[Kasius]] for an explanation of his brother being given priority over purchasing [[Quake]], angrily saying that he was promised a chance to bid. Kasius simply dismisses him, however, urging him to bid for other [[Inhumans]]. Enoch secretly hands Fitz an [[I.C.E.R.]] before leaving, to help him carry out the rest of his plan.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS506"/>
*<!--21:40-->A Kree reaper investigates Grill's salvage. The team are relived when he leaves without finding anyone, having been hiding behind the door in Grill's office.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS506"/>
*<!--22:00-->Faulnak arrives at the [[Crater]] fighting arena, and Kasius makes a slight mockery of him working as merely their father's "messenger". Faulnak states that, for the fight, [[Quake]] should prove her worth by fighting not with another Inhuman, but with [[Sinara]], his "greatest warrior". Kasius reluctantly agrees, and Sinara becomes angry at him, but accepts that she has to fight.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS506"/>
*<!--22:20-->[[Flint]] says he wants to leave, feeling guilty for killing Grill. The team reassures him that it was not his fault that Grill made it necessary for himself to be killed, and that Flint saved their lives.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS506"/>
*<!--22:40-->Coulson and Mackenzie leave to find [[Tess]] so she can help get Flint to safety on the [[Trawler]], but are shocked when they suddenly stumble across Tess' dead body, left to float using an activated [[Gravity Puck]], with the warning sign attached to her body by the Kree reading, "Bring the Inhuman."<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS506"/>
*<!--23:00-->'''[[Inhuman Trial Ceremony]]''':
**In the crater, Johnson is taken to fight Sinara. The women engage in a fierce duel, and Johnson looks set to defeat her, but Sinara uses her controlled balls to knock Johnson aside. Johnson nonetheless manages to regain control and when Sinara next uses the balls to attack, she quakes them away from her.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS506"/>
**Johnson and Sinara enter close quarters combat, and Johnson eventually manages to kick Sinara away from her. When the Kree runs back at her, she then targets her head with a quake, sending her falling backwards to the ground and knocking her out.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS506"/>
**Quake gives Fitz and Simmons a signal to act and they rebel against [[Kasius]], with Simmons attacking him with her knife, slicing open his cheek, and Fitz deactivating the energy shield separating them from the Crater. Quake uses her powers to rise up to the guests' level, but [[Faulnak]] turns on her inhibitor, causing her powers to falter and her to fall to the ground.<ref name="AoS5 2091 Placement"/><ref name="AoS506"/>
**Simmons goes to climb out of the guest level and into the arena as Fitz I.C.E.-s several guests.
