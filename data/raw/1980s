===March===
*[[Robert Coleman]] is born.<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100010435931085&sk=about&section=year-overviews Jay Klaitz began high school in Florida in 1991], meaning he was born between September 2, 1979 and September 1, 1980 - approximately March 2-3, 1980. He only appears alive in ''[[AKA Start at the Beginning]]'', the middle of filming for which was approximately April 9-10, 2017, meaning he was approximately 13,552 days old. The average date of Whizzer's scenes is April 25, 2017, which, working back 13,552 days, would make his date of birth roughly March 1980.</ref>

====31st====
[[File:Meredith Quill & Ego (King Cobra - 1980).png|thumb|250px|[[Meredith Quill]] spending time with [[Ego]]]]
*[[Meredith Quill]], approximately 8 weeks pregnant with [[Peter Quill|her son]], rides in a car with [[Ego]] in [[Missouri]]. He takes her to see his seedling, and she happily embraces him.<ref name="GotGV2"/><ref name="GotG Meredith and Peter Dates">In ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', it is shown that the Kidnapping of Peter Quill was "1988," and then the Battle of Morag was "26 years later." The Battle of Morag is dated as August 1, 2014, ideally putting the Kidnapping of Peter Quill around August 1, 1988. In ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]'', it is shown that Ego and Meredith spent a day together in "1980," and then the Battle on Sovereign was "34 years later." The Battle on Sovereign is dated as October 17, 2014, ideally putting this scene around October 17, 1980. However, Quill is at least 8 years old at his kidnapping, plus realistically at least two weeks to keep his mother's death clear from his birthday. At a realistic maximum, Meredith Quill is 8 weeks pregnant in the 1980 scene, putting at least 30 weeks between that scene and Peter's birth. If the 1980 scene were October 17th, the earliest Peter could be born is May 15, 1981. If the 1988 scene were August 1st, the latest Peter could be born is July 18, 1980. The average of these two dates is December 15, 1980, putting the date of the 1980 scene as May 19th, and the 1988 scene as December 29th. Peter's clothing at his kidnapping indicates the 1988 scene should not be any earlier than early-to-mid-November. So with that at the latest date of November 10, 1988, this would put Peter's birthday around October 27, 1980, and the 1980 scene at March 31, 1980. This is all somewhat corroborated by James Gunn in [https://twitter.com/JamesGunn/status/863882306431328257 a Twitter post].</ref>

===April===
*[[Carl Lucas]] is born.<ref name="LC1 Willis and Carl DoBs">In ''[[You Know My Steez]]'', a flashback is shown of Willis training Carl at boxing. In the background is a notice about an event coming up on "Friday November 15" (which would be 1996) and then "Monday 6-10 January" (1997), placing this around early November 1996. It is shown in ''[[Take It Personal]]'' that in May of whichever year (it refers to the car being a "1993" model, so at least 1994 or 1995 to refer to it as such), when Willis was 18 and Carl was 17, they stole a 1993 corvette. It can be assumed, considering the fact that the actors already look older than 16 and 18 in the November 1996 flashback and Mike Colter's age at the times of filming suggesting Luke would have turned 17 around the early 1990s, as well as the way the brothers' story is told, it can be assumed that they stole the car in the first May after the November 1996 flashback, May 1997. In ''Take It Personal'', Luke says, "He was 2 years older than me," and in ''[[Now You're Mine]]'', Willis says, "And everything was good until the preacher's wife, 2 years later, had a baby boy." With the paper saying they are 17 and 18 in May 1997, it can be assumed that they are about 1 year and 10 months apart in age, with Carl having just turned 17 and Willis about to turn 19, placing their dates of birth in April 1980 and June 1978 respectively.</ref><ref name="LC110">''[[Take It Personal|Luke Cage: 1.10: Take It Personal]]''</ref><ref name="LC113">''[[You Know My Steez|Luke Cage: 1.13: You Know My Steez]]''</ref>

With her date of birth approximated to February 1975 (see [[1970s]] references), specifically February 28, 1975, the middle of Connors' time as a 5-year-old (as an approximation for when she last saw Pop) would be August 28, 1980.</ref>

Based on a weighted average working with this information, Anson Mount, Serinda Swan, Eme Ikwuakor, Iwan Rheon, and Isabelle Cornish's ages at the middle of filming for ''Inhumans'': Season 1, working back from when it is set, as well as Lofton Show, Aidan Fiske, and Leila Bootsma's ages at the middle of filming for the show, the characters' dates of birth would be Black Bolt around October 1982, Medusa around April 1983, Gorgon around May 1985, Maximus around June 1985, and Crystal around September 1991, with Black Bolt and Medusa meeting when Medusa is nearly 14½ and Black Bolt is about to turn 15, in September 1997.

Akira Akbar herself was 11.6 years old during filming, suggesting Rambeau is slightly closer to 11.99 than 11.0. Overall, 1995 Rambeau's appearances would suggest she was born around December 1983.<br>Azari Akbar, who plays Rambeau in flashbacks (late 1980s), is credited as "Monica Rambeau (5 Years Old)", making Rambeau approximately 5.5. Azari Akbar herself was 6.7 years old during filming, suggesting Rambeau is slightly closer to 5.99 than 5.0. Working forwards from December 1989, her appearances would then be around mid-1989. They cannot be later than June 21, 1989, with Danvers disappearing on June 22, 1989 (see [[1980s]] references) and the appearances set before then.<br>Two photos are shown of Azari Akbar's 5-year-old Monica Rambeau in the film: one from a Halloween, and one from a Christmas, both before Danvers' disappearance. So, the closest Halloween and Christmas to the ideal mid-1989 placement for Azari Akbar's appearances, while still being pre-June 22, 1989, are Halloween 1988 and Christmas 1988.<br>With these then firmly placed, working back from Rambeau being roughly a little over 5.5, this would then suggest Rambeau was born around April 1983. Combined with the aforementioned evidence for around December 1983, taking a weighted calculation, Rambeau's date of birth can then overall be approximated to September 1983.

David later says that their first kiss was in "junior year", implying they would have been born around 1985. However, Ebon Moss-Bachrach was 39 and Jaime Ray Newman was 38 at the time of filming ''The Punisher'': Season 1, set in late 2016, suggesting they were born closer to 1977-1978.

*<!--19:40-->Young nun novitiate [[Maggie Grace]], 3 weeks from taking her vows, goes with two friends to watch a boxing match in [[Fogwell's Gym]], wanting to have some fun before becoming a nun. As a round of the fight ends, one of the fighters, [[Jack Murdock]], requests for her to get him some water and wipe his face during the break. She steps up to help him, despite her friends wanting them to leave, and he explains he trusted her not to put anything in his drink, being a nun.<ref name="DD309 Flashbacks and Murdock DoB">It is said in ''[[Stick]]'' and ''[[The Perfect Game]]'' that Matt Murdock was "9" when he lost his sight. With that dated to May 12, 1994 (see [[1990s]] references), he would have been born between May 13, 1984 and May 12, 1985. Him starting college is dated to Fall 2003 (see [[2000s]] references), which would imply he was around 18 at the time, suggesting he was born between September 1, 1984 and August 31, 1985, so overall likely between September 1, 1984 and May 12, 1985. It is implied in ''Stick'' that Murdock is no longer 9 by his first meeting with Stick, as he refers to being blinded when he was 9. With that scene dated to January 12, 1995 (see [[1990s]] references), this would mean he was 10 by then, so born no later than January 12, 1985, and thus likely between September 1, 1984 and January 12, 1985.<br>In ''[[Revelations]]'', Maggie Grace is said in flashbacks to be 3 weeks from taking her vows as a nun when she meets Jack Murdock, and in present day explains when she conceived Matt, she had not yet taken her vows. So, Grace becoming a nun must have been shortly after Matt's conception, about 9 months before his birth. This would mean she became a nun approximately between December 1983 and April 1984. She states in September 2017 (see [[2017]] references), in ''[[Resurrection]]'', that she has been a nun for "30 years". So, while she must be rounding down whatever the case, April 1984 works best, and therefore an approximate early January 1985 date of birth for Matt Murdock.<br>Assuming Murdock's 30th birthday must occur in January 2015 before the events of ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'': [[Daredevil (TV series)/Season One|Season 1]], the latest Murdock could have been born is January 8, 1985. Assuming his date of birth is around then, 267 days earlier (an average pregnancy from conception to birth) would put Jack Murdock and Maggie Grace sleeping together as around April 16, 1984. Assuming that this was later in the 3-week span between them meeting and Grace becoming a nun, rather than earlier, it can be estimated to around 2 days before her vows (not the day before, as she would likely mention that detail when saying it was before her vows, were that the case). So, Grace becoming a nun can be approximated to April 18, 1984, and her meeting Jack Murdock therefore March 28, 1984.<br>With Murdock appearing to be roughly 3-4 months old in the scene showing Grace's post-partum depression, this is estimated to 3.5 months after his approximate date of birth, so April 23, 1985.</ref><ref name="DD309">''[[Revelations|Daredevil: 3.09: Revelations]]''</ref>

This partially informs the dating of the flashback events of ''[[Karen (episode)|Karen]]'' to March 2004 (see [[2000s]] references), with it said to be her gap year, but at the same time other evidence also places it in March 2004, thus suggesting Page graduated high school in Spring 2003, making her most likely born between September 1984 and August 1985, so also around early 1985. On [https://marvel.propstoreauction.com/m/lot-details/index/catalog/198/lot/42775/?url=%2Fm%2Fview-auctions%2Fcatalog%2Fid%2F198%2F%3Fpage%3D4%26items%3D96 Marvel Television Live Auction Lot #368: Karen Page's New York Bulletin Press Badge and News Agency Identification], it is shown that Page is supposed to be "31" (even though the ID says male, it is intended to be hers) during the main events of ''Daredevil'': Season 2 in October-November 2015 (see [[2015]] references), so likely born around the first half of 1984.

However, a calculation based on Rachael Taylor's age at the times of filming ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]'': [[Jessica Jones (TV series)/Season One|Season 1]], ''[[The Defenders]]'': [[The Defenders/Season One|Season 1]], and ''Jessica Jones'': [[Jessica Jones (TV series)/Season Two|Season 2]] and working back from each season's timeline setting, then taking a weighted average, would place Walker's date of birth around March 1984.

However, using Chris Carfizzi's age at the time of filming ''No Good Deed'', working back from the setting, Jason Ellison would have been born around April 1975. Jason says Mitchell and Lily Ellison renewed their wedding vows when he was 8, but, using these ages, Lily would have only been around 13. So, Lily Ellison must have been born earlier than January 1970, and Jason later than April 1975.

Using 1986, since this is already 4 years after finishing high school - plausible for finishing college, but any later years become decreasingly plausible. So, approximately May 1986.</ref><ref name="CM"/>

This would suggest approximately August 30, 1987. However, it may more roughly just mean "2017 - 1987 = 30", so any time in 1987 (using mid-1987 as an approximation), or even more roughly just mean "2010s - 1980s = 30", so any time in the 1980s (using mid-1980s as an approximation).

*[[Jackson Dillard]] and [[Mariah Stokes]] are married, with Stokes taking the Dillard surname.<ref name="LC2 Tilda Fake Age">In ''[[Wig Out]]'', Mariah Dillard says, "The day I found out I was pregnant was the day that [Jackson Dillard] was shot and killed by the Contras." It is later revealed that this is a lie, and Tilda Johnson does not know her real age either. However, the timeline must approximately line up with Johnson's fake date of birth to not arouse suspicion. It is said in ''[[For Pete's Sake]]'' that Mariah and Jackson were engage at the time of Peter Stokes' death, which is dated to April 6, 1987 (see other references). So, their wedding, Jackson starting his work in Nicaragua, and Jackson being killed all occur after April 6, 1987, and then about 8 further months occur before Johnson's fake date of birth, meaning that date of birth cannot be earlier than December 1987. Assuming Johnson's birthday was kept the same, just the year changed, then with her real date of birth approximated to August 1985 (see other references), specifically August 20th, then her fake date of birth can be assumed as the first available August 20th after December 1987: August 20, 1988. If Jackson was killed about 242 days prior (the approximate amount of time between a woman finding out she is pregnant and giving birth), for Mariah's lie to be believable, then he would have died around December 21, 1987. The wedding and move to Nicaragua can then be distributed evenly between April 6, 1987 and December 21, 1987, giving approximately July 3, 1987 for the wedding and September 30, 1987 for the move to Nicaragua.</ref><ref name="LC209"/>

Danvers dresses as {{WPS|Janis Joplin}} and Monica dresses as {{WPS|Amelia Earhart}}, and they have their photo taken.<ref name="CM 5-Year-Old Rambeau">In ''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]'', three instances are shown of a young child Monica Rambeau: a photo of her with Carol Danvers at Halloween, a photo of her with Danvers at Christmas, and a memory of her with Danvers looking at the stars. Judging from Rambeau being credited as 11 in June 1995 and actress Akira Akbar being 11.6 at the time of filming, Rambeau's date of birth would be approximated to December 1983 (see final approximated date of birth, September 1983, references for further explanation).<br>Azari Akbar is credited as "Monica Rambeau (5 Years Old)", making Rambeau approximately 5.5. Azari Akbar herself was 6.7 years old during filming, suggesting Rambeau is slightly closer to 5.99 than 5.0. Working forwards from December 1989, her appearances would then be around mid-1989. They cannot be later than June 21, 1989, with Danvers disappearing on June 22, 1989 (see other references) and the appearances set before then.<br>So, the closest Halloween and Christmas to the ideal mid-1989 placement for Azari Akbar's appearances, while still being pre-June 22, 1989, are Halloween 1988 and Christmas 1988. This then also had an effect on finally placing Rambeau's date of birth as September 1983 (see other references).<br>Finally, placing the memory with the stars, with Azari Akbar credited as playing "Monica Rambeau (5 Years Old)", Rambeau would be approximately 5.5. Again, Azari Akbar herself was 6.7 years old during filming, suggesting Rambeau is slightly closer to 5.99 than 5.0.<br>With Rambeau's date of birth dated to September 1983, so it can be calculated that this scene takes place around roughly April 25, 1989.

*During training for the [[United States Air Force]], [[Carol Danvers]] partakes in an exercise wherein she has to jump from one rope to another and catch onto it. She is taunted by her otherwise male colleagues, who say she does not have the strength and will end up killing herself.<ref name="CM Danvers Pilot Flashbacks">In ''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]'', as the Skrulls cycle through Carol Danvers' memories, they first see the memory of Danvers with Maria Rambeau about to perform a test flight. They then go back to Danvers as a child, but have gone too far back, so go forward and see her doing rope training, presumably some time before the test flight because it is at the training stage, but also because they are trying to narrow down to the right memory. This memory then continues into one with Danvers being belittled in Pancho's Bar and, seemingly the same day (Danvers is in the same T-shirt), her playing pool with Rambeau. This continues into another memory of Pancho's Bar, karaoke. Following this, there is a memory of Danvers as a child watching the stars, then her with the Rambeaus watching the stars. There is no reason the Skrulls would have gone further back than the go karting to see an ever younger Danvers, knowing this to be too far back, so her as a child can be taken as a memory within Danvers' memory of watching the stars with Monica Rambeau, something she recalled as she did it, in which case the stars follows on from the karaoke and is still before the test flight with Maria Rambeau. Norex then finds the moment of Danvers with "Lawson". Since they are narrowing down where the memory is, it should presumably still be between the stars and the test flight.<br>So, the chronology is the rope scene, then the man and pool at Pancho's, then karaoke at Pancho's, then watching the stars, then Lawson, then the test flight. And we know that, after all of this, was Danvers' crash with Lawson/Mar-Vell and her being abducted by Starforce.<br>The abduction is said through the film, mostly on June 12, 1995 (see other references), and through external sources, to be both "6 years ago" and in "1989". So, it can be taken to be somewhere between exactly 6 years prior - June 12, 1989 - and the approximation for "1989" of the exact middle of 1989 - July 2, 1989 - making the crash and abduction roughly June 22, 1989.<br>With the watching the stars dated to April 25, 1989 (see other references) and the abduction dated to June 22, 1989, Lawson and the test flight can be approximated as ⅓ and ⅔ between the two, so May 14, 1989 and June 3, 1989 respectively.<br>So, with Danvers flying the planes by May 14, 1989, the rope training scene can be approximated to be 6 months or so prior - roughly November 14, 1988. This then means that the man and pool at Pancho's and karaoke at Pancho's can be approximated as ⅓ and ⅔ between November 14, 1988 and April 25, 1989, so January 7, 1989 and March 2, 1989 respectively.</ref><ref name="CM"/>

*'''[[Attack on Wakanda]]''': Using information provided by [[N'Jobu]], who has become radicalized during his time on a [[War Dogs]] assignment in [[Oakland]], [[California]], black market arms dealer [[Ulysses Klaue]] enters the hidden kingdom of [[Wakanda]] in East [[Africa]] and steals a large amount of [[vibranium]]. He causes damage to their protective dome and becomes the first person in the country's history to escape.<ref>In ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'', on July 1, 2016 (see references on [[2016]]), T'Challa says that Klaue "escaped our pursuits for almost 30 years". W'Kabi later says, "For 30 years your father was in power and did nothing," referring to Klaue, and to the time that spanned between his attack and T'Chaka's death, dated to June 22, 2016. As well as this, W'Kabi says in a [https://www.comicbookmovie.com/black_panther/black-panther-deleted-scene-features-a-husband-and-wife-confrontation-between-okoye-and-wkabi-a160180 deleted scene], on July 4, 2016, that when it comes to Klaue, for "30 years, there's been no justice". While these pieces of dialogue would imply the attack was around 1987, the film also shows scenes set in "1992" which depict the attack as having been recent. Weighted calculations from all the evidence and factors gives April 24, 1989 as the approximate best-fitting date for the attack, and January 15, 1992 as the approximate best-fitting date for the "1992" scenes. The calculations for these dates and the other events are all relative to each other, and can be found in detail [[User blog:BEJT/Black Panther Past Dates|here]].</ref><ref name="BP">''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]''</ref>

This could specifically refer to 6 years prior, roughly June 12, 1989, or more generally "1995 - 6 = 1989", so approximated with mid-1989, July 2, 1989.
