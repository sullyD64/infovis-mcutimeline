===June===
====20th====
*'''[[Skirmish in Ixtenco]]''': [[Talos]] and [[Soren]] (disguised as [[Nick Fury]] and [[Maria Hill]]) arrive in [[Ixtenco]], [[Mexico]] where they encounter [[Mysterio]], battling the [[Sandman]].<ref>In ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'', on Friday, June 28, 2024 (see other references), "Fury" says the event in Ixtenco was "a week ago". This would specifically suggest it was around June 21, 2024, but could more generally mean "the week of June 23-29, 2024 - 1 week = week of June 16-22, 2024", so approximately June 19, 2024. Overall, it can be approximated to June 20, 2024.</ref><ref name="SMFFH">''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]''</ref>

==== 26th ====
* [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] talks to [[Ned Leeds]] about his plans for the day, and the errands he has to complete.<ref name=PTDL">[[Peter's To-Do List]]</ref><ref name=PTDL Placement">In [[Peter's To-Do List|''Peter's To-Do List'']]'', ''it is said that Peter has to complete his errands for the trip "tomorrow." Since the class leaves for the trip on June 27th, this dates to events of ''Peter's To-Do List'' to June 26th,</ref>
* Parker goes to [[Delmar's Deli-Grocery]] in order to buy a dual headphone adapter. He attempts to ask for it in Spanish, and [[Delmar]] corrects him.<ref name=PTDL" /><ref name=PTDL Placement" />
* Parker picks up a passport.<ref name=PTDL" /><ref name=PTDL Placement" />
* Parker sells his toys, excluding a Zoloft action figure, so that he can afford to buy a gift for [[Michelle Jones]] while in Europe.<ref name=PTDL" /><ref name=PTDL Placement" />
* '''[[Attack on the Manfredi Crime Family]]: '''Parker, as Spider-Man, goes to the restaurant in Upper Manhattan and takes down the [[Manfredi Crime Family]].<ref name=PTDL" /><ref name=PTDL Placement" />
* The police arrive at the restaurant and congratulate Spider-Man on taking down the family. Officer [[Bristow]] asks Spider-Man if he plans on being the new [[Iron Man]], and Parker says that he's too buys doing the NYPD's job. He tells Bristow and the other officers that he's going on vacation.<ref name=PTDL" /><ref name=PTDL Placement" />
* In the wake of Parker's defeat of the Manfredis, the [[Mafia Cold War]] turns hot.<ref name="TDB" />

====27th====
*After completing an all-new school year following the [[Blip]], [[Peter Parker]]'s class from the [[Midtown School of Science and Technology]] leaves for their European trip.<ref name="SMFFH Summer 2024 Placement">In ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', events begin in mid-2018, then the film jumps to "five years later", making it 2023. This is supported later when, in 2014, Ebony Maw says that Nebula has come from "9 years in the future", 2023. In ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'', Betty Brant says on the last day of school, in late June, that the snapped people were brought back "8 months" ago. This would place Hulk's snap in October, so October 2023. Therefore, 8 months later, this is June 2024.<br>In June 2019, which has the same days of the week as June 2024, New York high schools finished on June 26th ([https://stuy.enschool.org/apps/events2/view_calendar.jsp?id=0&m=5&y=2019 1], [https://www.thhs.qc.edu/apps/events/2019/6/?id=0 2], [https://hsmse.org/about-us/school-calendar/ 3]), so the most likely date for the last day of school in the 2023-2024 academic year is June 26, 2024. This scene is preceded by Mysterio arriving in Ixtenco, Mexico. ''[[Peter's To-Do List]]'' reveals that it is the day after the end of term that Peter Parker and his classmates go on [https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-avengers-4-trailers-are-going-to-have-a-weird-marke-1827106179 summer vacation] (on the last day of term, Ned Leeds asks Peter Parker what he will do with his "last day in New York"), beginning in Venice.<br>In the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYYtuKyMtY8&t=37s first trailer] and in [https://www.instagram.com/p/B0UPNUJHHqQ/ an official social media post], Peter Parker's passport is shown to be issued on "JUL 19" and "19 JULY" respectively, and on the [https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/marvelcinematicuniverse/images/e/e8/Spider-Man_-_Far_From_Home_%28poster%29.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190115163723 first poster] and [https://cdnph.upi.com/svc/sv/upi/5611561640044/2019/1/4538806b174c563a431f97f6f25624d1/Zendaya-wears-Spider-Man-inspired-dress-to-Far-From-Home-premiere.jpg background art], the passport stamps for Berlin and London are both for "24 JUL". However, by the end of school dates, the trip would be June 27th-July 3rd. Since the passport scene is not in the film and the passport stamps on the poster/background art are already erroneous, saying the year is "19" when it is 2024, these can be discarded in favor of what the film says. This makes Venice June 28th, Prague June 30th, Berlin July 1st, and London July 2nd.</ref><ref name="SMFFH"/>
*Quentin Beck covertly followed Parker on his school trip at JFK Airport, after his [[Quentin Beck's Crew|crew]] learned [[Iron Man|Stark]] had left him an [[E.D.I.T.H.|inheritance]].<ref name="SMFFH Summer 2024 Placement"/><ref name="SMFFH"/>

====28th====
*'''[[Battle in the Grand Canal]]''': Following Parker's class' arrival in [[Venice]], [[Italy]], an attack by the [[Hydro-Man|Water Elemental]] took place destroying several buildings.

*Nick Fury visits Parker in his hotel and takes him to a "mission control" office where Maria Hill and [[Nick Fury's Crew|other agents]] are getting briefed by Quentin Beck, who tells that the next of the [[Elementals]] will strike in [[Prague]].

*Following the battle, Peter thinks Mysterio is better at being the next Iron Man than him and enables Beck to use E.D.I.T.H. Once he leaves, Mysterio celebrates with [[Quentin Beck's Crew|his crew]] of former [[Stark Industries]] employees for having succeeded in their plan, while planning an even bigger Elemental to cement Mysterio as the newest superhero in the public eye.<ref name="SMFFH Summer 2024 Placement"/><ref name="SMFFH"/>
*Parker and [[Michelle Jones]] talk on a bridge. She reveals she had found out he was Spider-Man, and had discovered a strange device in the battle site, that once accidentally activated turns out to be a projector used by Mysterio. Parker realizes he had been duped, and ventures to [[Berlin]] to meet with Fury about Mysterio's deception.<ref name="SMFFH Summer 2024 Placement"/><ref name="SMFFH"/>

===July===
====1st====
*'''[[Ambush in Berlin]]''': Parker arrives in Berlin and is received by Fury, but that turns out to be a trap by Mysterio, and the illusionist ultimately makes Parker be hit by a train.<ref name="SMFFH Summer 2024 Placement"/><ref name="SMFFH"/>

With that event dated to Friday, June 28, 2024 (see other references), this would specifically suggest it is around July 5, 2024, but could more generally mean "the week of June 23-29, 2024 + 1 week = week of June 30-July 6, 2024", so approximately July 3, 2024. Overall, it can be approximated to July 4, 2024.</ref><ref name="SMFFH"/>
*After receiving Talos' message, Nick Fury gets up from his augmented reality beach vacation and says that they have some work to do, looking out at the Skrull crew manning the ship he is on.<ref name="SMFFH Post-Credits"/><ref name="SMFFH"/>
