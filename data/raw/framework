However, in ''[[The Return]]'', a few weeks later, Daisy Johnson says that in the Framework, Hope is 10. It would make sense if the reason Hope didn't make it in the real world is because she was born a couple of months prematurely, at around 24 weeks, but in the Framework she was born in August at full-term (40 weeks), and therefore has not yet turned 11 in the Framework in May 2017.</ref>

Based on the September 2008 date for the Cambridge Incident, the time it would take for the public to completely turn to HYDRA, and the amount of decomposition of the corpse next to Simmons in 2017, the year is 2009. This also fits better with Fitz saying Simmons is in her "mid 20s" in ''[[What If...]]'', as Simmons would be 29 otherwise, but if her body is the biological age she was when she died, she'd be 22, albeit a bit older-looking for her age.</ref>
