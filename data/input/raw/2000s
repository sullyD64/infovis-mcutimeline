This is a timeline of events that occurred during the 2000s.

==2000==
*{{WPS|The Decemberists}} are formed.<ref name="Real Events"/><ref name="C&D106">''[[Funhouse Mirrors|Cloak & Dagger: 1.06: Funhouse Mirrors]]''</ref>

===January===
====1st====
*'''[[Bern 2000]]''': New Year's Day comes, and the distraught [[Aldrich Killian]] is still waiting for [[Tony Stark]] on the roof of a building in [[Bern]], [[Switzerland]], because Stark promised to meet him there. Meanwhile, Stark chose to party and sleep with [[Maya Hansen]]. Seeing the New Year's celebrations below Killian gets inspired to continue his work without Stark.<ref name="IM3"/>
*That morning, [[Maya Hansen]] wakes up to find Stark has discreetly left her.<ref name="IM3">''[[Iron Man 3]]''</ref>

====3rd====
*[[Aldrich Killian]] accepts [[Maya Hansen]] into [[A.I.M.]], and they continue to develop the [[Extremis]] virus.<ref name="IM3"/>

===February===
====25th====
*''{{WPS|Reindeer Games}}'' is released in the [[United States of America]].<ref name="Real Events">Sometimes the ''Marvel Cinematic Universe'' alludes to events which happened in our world, and it is assumed they happened on the same dates in the universe, for timeline purposes.</ref><ref name="TTDWP">''[[Thor: The Dark World Prelude]]''</ref>

===March===
*[[Flash Thompson|Eugene Thompson]], later known by the nickname "Flash", is born.<ref>[http://newyorkschooltalk.org/2016/10/nyc-give-parents-flexibility-kindergarten-start-dates/ In New York, students start kindergarten (the year before 1st grade) in September of the calendar year in which they turn 5]. With [http://newyorkschooltalk.org/2016/10/nyc-give-parents-flexibility-kindergarten-start-dates/ Flash being a junior (11th grade) in September 2016], this means he turns 16 in the calendar year of 2016 - meaning he was born in 2000. Considering Tony Revolori's age, Flash would have been born earlier rather than later in his school year, around March 2000.</ref><ref name="SMH"/>

[[File:Accident-Jones.png|thumb|250px|Jones' family accident]]
*14-year-old [[Jessica Jones]], her parents, [[Brian Jones]] and [[Alisa Jones]], and her 10-year-old brother, [[Phillip Jones]] leave for an Easter vacation. Her father gets distracted, due to a fight between Jessica and Phillip over a video game, causing their car to crash with a truck that is carrying a container of chemicals. The Jones family die in the crash. Eventually, the corpse of Jessica is retrieved by [[IGH]], they do experiments on her resurrecting her, but giving her powers as a side effect. The horrific experience would affect Jessica's deeply as she decided to investigate the situation [[2017|17 years later]].<ref name="JJ1 2000 Placement">In ''[[AKA Take a Bloody Number]]'', it is shown that the medical bills for Jessica following her family's car crash are from "04/13/00". This would suggest that the accident was soon before/on this date. It is taken as being the exact date, as that is about the earliest it could be for the family to be going on vacation - Easter vacation, 10 days before Easter Sunday. This fits with the fact that when Jessica looks at her diary from old home in ''[[AKA Top Shelf Perverts]]'', it is shown that her entries were infrequent, and her last was in September 1999.</ref><ref name="JJ108">''[[AKA WWJD?|Jessica Jones: 1.08: AKA WWJD?]]''</ref><ref name="JJ2 Trailer">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSvnepZS26s Jessica Jones Season 2 Trailer Reveals Amazing Details]</ref>
*Talent agent [[Dorothy Walker]] pays [[IGH]] for Jones' medical bills while she is comatose, hoping to adopt her as a publicity stunt to promote her daughter [[Trish Walker|Patsy]]'s television show.<ref name="JJ1 2000 Placement"/><ref name="JJ108"/>

====23rd====
*[[Alisa Jones]] wakes in the [[Industrial Garments & Handling Facility]], bewildered. She is greeted by a nurse named [[Luanne McClure]], who tries to calm her down. However, when Jones sees her reflection and sees her face mangled and burned, she panics and becomes angry, breaking out of the room and attacking nurses in the corridor to escape. She finds a girl walking down the corridor and grabs hold of her, but a doctor at the facility, [[Karl Malus]], gets to her and sedates her, informing her that the girl is her daughter, [[Jessica Jones|Jessica]], so she should not want to hurt her.<ref>In ''[[AKA Start at the Beginning]]'', it is said that Jessica Jones was at IGH for 20 days. With her family's car crash being April 13, 2000, she was therefore at the facility from April 13, 2000 to May 3, 2000. Since Alisa's first waking is during this span, it can be assumed that it was approximately the middle of this period, April 23, 2000.</ref><ref name="JJ207">''[[AKA I Want Your Cray Cray|Jessica Jones: 2.07: AKA I Want Your Cray Cray]]''</ref>

====25th====
*[[Trish Walker]] visits [[Sally]]'s wig shop for the last time before [[2017]].<ref>In ''[[AKA God Help the Hobo]]'', Trish Walker says on May 6, 2017 (see [[2017]] references) that Sally's wig shop "hasn't changed in 17 years". This could be referring to 17 years before May 6, 2017, approximately May 6, 2000, or more generally "2017 - 17 = 2000", the approximation for which would be the middle of 2000, July 1-2, 2000. Putting more weight on the specific date, a calculation would place Walker's last time visiting the shop around May 25, 2000.</ref><ref name="JJ204">''[[AKA God Help the Hobo|Jessica Jones: 2.04: AKA God Help the Hobo]]''</ref>

===August===
====4th====
*''{{WPS|Dora the Explorer}}'' airs its first episode. The show would include the character like Dora Márquez.<ref name="Real Events"/><ref name="IM3"/>

===November===
*In [[Sokovia]], a mortar shell hits the home of the Maximoff family. The parents are killed, and twins [[Pietro Maximoff|Pietro]] and [[Wanda Maximoff]], aged 10, are left trapped in the rubble. Another shell falls, but does not detonate. The twins are left stuck for 2 days, terrified that any slight movement could set it off. All they can see, until they are rescued, is the name on the shell - "[[Stark Industries|Stark]]".<ref>Based on weighted calculations from Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen's ages at the times of shooting each film in which they feature, and working backwards from the settings of each film, the approximate date of birth for the twins is September 1990. The calculations for these dates can be found in detail [http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/d/p/3120688743317563529 here].<br>In ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', it is said that the Maximoffs' parents died when the twins were "10". The middle of their time being aged 10 would place the parents' deaths around November 2000.</ref><ref name="AAoU"/>

===December===
*[[Max Tatum]] sexually harasses [[Trish Walker]], only 15, on the set of a film he is making.<ref>In ''[[AKA Freak Accident]]'', Trish Walker says she was "15" when Max Tatum harassed her. Her date of birth is approximated at June 1985 (see [[1980s]] references), so this is between June 2000 and June 2001, approximately December 2000.</ref><ref>''[[AKA Freak Accident|Jessica Jones: 2.02: AKA Freak Accident]]''</ref>

===February===
====7th====
*In junior year, [[David Lieberman]] spends an evening with his classmate [[Sarah Lieberman|Sarah]] after a party, and they end up kissing. They would become a couple, eventually ending in their marriage.<ref>In ''[[Cold Steel]]'', Sarah Lieberman says on November 28, 2016 that she has kissed no one other than David for "15 years", implying that her first kiss with David was 15 years ago, in 2001. David later says that their first kiss was in "junior year", implying they would have been born around 1985. However, Ebon Moss-Bachrach was 39 and Jaime Ray Newman was 38 at the time of filming ''The Punisher'': Season 1, set in late 2016, suggesting they were born closer to 1977-1978. Overall, it can be calculated that they were born around February 1984, juniors 2000-2001, and first kissed around February 7, 2001. The details of the calculations can be found [[User:Marvelus/Netflix (2017-) Shows Timeline|here]].</ref><ref name="TP108"/>

===March===
====8th====
*[[Harold Meachum]] is diagnosed with cancer.<ref name="IF1 Harold Diagnosis">In ''[[Eight Diagram Dragon Palm]]'', Harold says, "I fought the good fight for 3 years." In ''[[Dragon Plays with Fire]]'', Gao says, "Harold was diagnosed with cancer. At most he had 2, 3 years to live." It can be surmised that he fought it for a little longer than expected the expected 2½ years, nearly 3 - around 2 years, 10 months. Working back from his reasoned date of death on January 4, 2004, he would have been diagnosed around March 2001.</ref><ref name="IF104">''[[Eight Diagram Dragon Palm|Iron Fist: 1.04: Eight Diagram Dragon Palm]]''</ref><ref name="IF113">''[[Dragon Plays with Fire|Iron Fist: 1.13: Dragon Plays with Fire]]''</ref>

====18th====
*The Rands and Meachums film a commercial for [[Rand Enterprises]].<ref name="IF1 Commercial">In ''[[Shadow Hawk Takes Flight]]'', Dr. Edmonds says the commercial was "from about 15 years ago." This is said on February 11, 2016, so 15 years prior would mean the commercial was released around March 30, 2001. The commercial is reasonably simple, so it would have been filmed only 1 or 2 weeks prior. This also fits with what Joy says in the same episode, that she was "about 10 years old" when they filmed the commercial. She would have been 10 from approximately October 2000 to October 2001, and March 2001 falls comfortably in that margin.</ref><ref name="IF102"/>

*[[Jimmy (Patient)|Jimmy]] is caught screaming at people in [[Times Square]], and taken to [[Birch Psychiatric Hospital]], where he would remain until at least [[2016]].<ref name="IF1 Jimmy Almost 15 Years">In ''[[Shadow Hawk Takes Flight]]'', Simon tells Danny Rand on February 10, 2016 that Jimmy has "been here almost 15 years". "Almost" can usually be taken to mean around 98.5%, putting it around May 3, 2001.</ref><ref name="IF102"/>

===May===
*[[James Lucas]] takes photographs of his son, [[Carl Lucas|Carl]], at his graduation.<ref>With Luke Cage's date of birth approximated to April 1980 (see [[1980s]] references), his graduation (pictures shown in ''[[For Pete's Sake]]'') would likely be May 2001.</ref><ref>''[[For Pete's Sake|Luke Cage: 2.09: For Pete's Sake]]''</ref>

===August===
====10th====
*[[Peter Parker]] is born.<ref name="Parker's Age">In ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' Peter Parker is said to be "15", and his birthday does not transpire during the film, for which the main events begin on September 8, 2016 and end on September 26, 2016 (the Monday following the homecoming dance on [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C9K8U3NWsAAs0s8.jpg September 23rd]), therefore meaning Parker was born between September 27, 2000 and September 7, 2001. On top of this, Jon Watts said, [http://www.pressreader.com/australia/empire-australasia/20170701/281513636097609 "the eight-year-old Peter had seen Stark say, 'I am Iron Man,' on TV."] "I am Iron Man" is dated to November 25, 2009 (see other references), putting Parker's birthday at the earliest on November 26, 2009. This would put his birthday in the range of November 26, 2000-September 7, 2001. Finally, [http://newyorkschooltalk.org/2016/10/nyc-give-parents-flexibility-kindergarten-start-dates/ in New York, students start kindergarten (the year before 1st grade) in September of the calendar year in which they turn 5]. With Parker being a sophomore (10th grade) in September 2016, this means he turns 15 in the calendar year of 2016 - meaning he was born in 2001. So, he was born between January 1, 2001 and September 7, 2001.<br>In ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'', it is shown on [[:File:Spider-ManFarFromHomeTeaserTrailer19.png|Parker's passport]] that he was born on "10 AUG", making his date of birth August 10, 2001.<br>Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have stated that in ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'', [http://time.com/4312912/captain-america-civil-war-stephen-mcfeely-christopher-markus/ Parker is 15 years old.] While this would work if his date of birth was before June 23, 2001 (his first appearance in ''Captain America: Civil War'' is on June 23, 2016), it does not fit with the "10 AUG" date of birth (chosen by Marvel as a reference to the August 10, 1962 ''Amazing Fantasy #15'' release date), and the date from the film has to overrule the writers' comment, making him 14 in ''Captain America: Civil War''.</ref>

[[File:Young Danny(2).png|thumb|255px|A young [[Danny Rand]] survives the [[Air Crash in the Himalayas|airplane crash]]]]
*'''[[Air Crash in the Himalayas]]''': The Rand family's airplane crashes in the Himalayas on the way to Anzhou, China. Unbeknownst to them, the pilots had been poisoned by The [[Hand]], on [[Harold Meachum]]'s orders. The only survivor is 10-year-old Danny Rand, who crawls in the frozen landscape and finds the body of his father, [[Wendell Rand]]. He is found by the [[Order of the Crane Mother]], who take Rand back to the city of [[K'un-Lun]].<ref name="IF1 Air Crash 2001">In ''[[Iron Fist (TV series)|Iron Fist]]'': [[Iron Fist (TV series)/Season One|Season 1]], throughout February 2016, there are many references to the air crash being 15 years ago:
<br>In ''[[Snow Gives Way]]'', Joy says, "It's been like 15 years since Danny and his parents died."
<br>In ''[[Shadow Hawk Takes Flight]]'', Ward says, "[Danny] waited 15 years to come back," Harold says, "Ask him where he's been the last 15 years," Dr. Edmonds says, "Where have you been in the last 15 years?", and Danny says that K'un-Lun "only appears on this earthly plane every 15 years, give or take, depending on the celestial tilt."
<br>In ''[[Eight Diagram Dragon Palm]]'', Danny says, "After living in a monastery for 15 years."
<br>In ''[[Immortal Emerges from Cave]]'', Danny says, "I've been doing this for 15 years."
<br>In ''[[The Blessing of Many Fractures]]'', Danny says, "I've spent the last 15 years learning..."
<br>In ''[[The Mistress of All Agonies]]'', Gao refers to the crash as "events that happened 15 years ago".
<br>Finally, in ''[[Dragon Plays with Fire]]'', Hogarth talks about "wherever the hell it is that you were for 15 years" and Claire refers to the crash as "something that happened 15 years ago."
<br>15 years prior would put this around early 2001, however, we know from ''[[Rolling Thunder Cannon Punch]]'' that the Rands were still around in July 2001. In ''[[The Mistress of All Agonies]]'', Ward Meachum's birthday is given as September 19, 1986 (see other references), and in ''[[Snow Gives Way]]'', Ward says, "I was 15 when [the Rands] died." This definitively places the air crash between September 19, 2001 and September 18, 2002. On top of this, the {{WPS|iPod}} 1st Generation, which Rand owns at the time of the crash, was released on October 23, 2001, and in the [[:File:New York Bulletin Joy and Ward Meachum Special Report|New York Bulletin | Joy and Ward Meachum Special Report]] video, it is said that Harold's death, which is [https://twitter.com/MarvelIronFist/status/842121466749452288 known to be 2004], albeit reasoned as early January, was "2 years" after the crash. From all of this, the accident is reasoned as October 29, 2001, six days after the iPod's release, a little over 2 years before January 4, 2004, and still reasonable enough to be considered "15 years" before February 2016, by the simple math of "2016 - 2001 = 15". This also allows time for Danny's arm to have healed since the break in July.
<br>While [http://www.zacharyzirlin.com/iron-fist/hl14k2gwamr2adw3bpekpmvm6cejfn prop-makers designed a September 2002 date for the crash], this does not match the other evidence, and when the props appear in  ''[[Rolling Thunder Cannon Punch]]'', the Rands' graves are intentionally obscured to not show the year of death, but only "200-", leaving the date ambiguous, and allowing for October 2001, which fits much better.</ref><ref name="IF101"/><ref name="IF102">''[[Shadow Hawk Takes Flight|Iron Fist: 1.02: Shadow Hawk Takes Flight]]''</ref><ref name="IF104"/><ref name="IF107">''[[Felling Tree with Roots|Iron Fist: 1.07: Felling Tree with Roots]]''</ref><ref name="IF113"/><ref>[https://marvel.propstoreauction.com/m/lot-details/index/catalog/198/lot/43094/?url=%2Fm%2Fview-auctions%2Fcatalog%2Fid%2F198%2F%3Fpage%3D8%26items%3D96 Marvel Television Live Auction Lot #687: Rand Enterprises Airline Safety Brochure and Rand Branded Napkin]</ref>

With Walker's capture dated to January 21, 2010 (see [[2010]] references), 8 years prior can be seen as exactly 8 years prior, approximately January 21, 2002, or more generally "2010 - 8 = 2002", so using mid-2002, July 2, 2002, as an approximation. Putting more weight in the specific than general, a weighted calculation gives the beginning of her service as approximately March 16, 2002.</ref>

*''[[Arkon (film)|Arkon]]'' is released in the [[United States of America]].<ref name="GotGV2 Simon Williams">[https://www.flickeringmyth.com/2017/05/james-gunn-on-cutting-nathan-fillions-simon-williams-cameo-from-guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2/ James Gunn detailed how Nathan Fillion originally had a cameo in ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2'' as actor Simon Williams, appearing on posters for films he has appeared in, on display at a film festival.] The films are ''Arkon'', ''Toxic Janitor 2'', ''Oh, Rebecca'', ''Haxan 2'', ''Dead Before Arrival'', and ''Tony Stark''. They are takes on ''Conan the Barbarian'', ''The Toxic Avenger Part II'', a late 2000s romantic comedy, ''Horns'', ''Inception'', and ''Steve Jobs'' respectively. With the fact that Williams seems to be roughly the same age in all the pictures (as they were all taken together), that he could not have looked to be in his 40s in 1982 (when ''Conan the Barbarian'' was released) and also films released in present day, that ''Steve Jobs'' was released in 2015, after the film's 2014 setting, and ''Horns'' was released 4 years after ''Inception'', when the ''Dead Before Arrival'' posters says it is "from the director of ''Haxan 2''", these films cannot simply replace their respective films in the ''Marvel Cinematic Universe''. ''Oh, Rebecca'' resembles a lot of romantic comedy films that were released around 2008, so it would make sense for it to have been released around Valentine's Day, February 14, 2008. ''Dead Before Arrival'' can still fit on the release date for ''Inception'', July 16, 2010. The fact that it is "from the director of ''Haxan 2''" means it is worth looking at the career of the director of Inception, Christopher Nolan, whose previous film was ''The Dark Knight'', released in 2008, which would imply that ''Haxan 2'' was released around 2008. It says it was released on "October 31", so October 31, 2008. The rights to make ''Steve Jobs'' were acquired 3 days after his death, and then it took 1476 days before it was released. Assuming the rights to make ''Tony Stark'' were acquired 3 days after "I am Iron Man", so November 28, 2009, the film would have come out around December 13, 2013. The remaining two films can presumably have been released in the order of the films they reference, so ''Arkon'', then ''Toxic Janitor 2''. Based on approximately how old Fillion was when he took the photos (using April 14, 2016, the middle of filming for ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2'', then working back from the approximate dates when Simon Williams would have filmed the movies (about November 6, 2006 for ''Haxan 2'' (based on the time between the middle of filming and release for ''Horns''), July 17, 2007 for ''Oh, Rebecca'' (based on the time between the middle of filming and release for 2008's ''Sex and the City'')), September 7, 2009 for ''Dead Before Arrival'' (based on the filming schedule for ''Inception''), and April 19, 2013 for ''Tony Stark'' (based on the time between the middle of filming and release for ''Steve Jobs'') and taking an average, Simon Williams would have been born approximately in April 1964. Nathan Fillion was about 32 years and 9 months old when the first film that he was the main actor in, ''Water's Edge'', was released on January 27, 2004. If Simon Williams were roughly the same age at the time of the first film in which he was the main actor, this first film would have come out around February 16, 1997. Therefore, his career as being the headline actor would have spanned from then to October 19, 2014 (when the film festival scene would have been set in ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2''), and so distributing the two films at a third and two thirds of the way between these dates would put ''Arkon'' around January 8 (rounded to 10th, the nearest Friday), 2003, and ''Toxic Janitor 2'' around November 28, 2008.</ref><ref name="GotGV2"/>

*[[Melinda May]] has her first date with [[Andrew Garner]].<ref name="AoS4 Russian Flashbacks">In ''[[Melinda]]'', it is shown that May and Garner were already married on the reasoned date of May 15, 2008. They appear to have only been married for a short time - back from their honeymoon and back to work, but only recently starting their new routine. Assuming they have been married for around 5 months, they would have got married around December 15, 2007. The [https://www.theknot.com/content/too-long-to-be-engaged average time between engagement and marriage is 14.5 months], putting the engagement around September 30, 2006, and the [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-515470/The-average-man-proposes-years--average-woman-wants-pop-question-months-earlier.html average time between meeting and marriage is 2 years, 11 months, 8 days], putting May and Garner's first date around October 23, 2003. In the flashbacks in ''[[The Man Behind the Shield]]'', it is shown that they have just met recently. It is said that this is the "weekend" and her time could have been spent as time with Garner soon after that first date - the second Saturday following October 23, 2003 was November 1st. This also fits with Coulson's security level progression over time. Coulson progressed to Level 7 around the time of ''Marvel One-Shot: The Consultant'', which is dated to July 2010, and he implies in ''All the Madame's Men'' that he was recruited into S.H.I.E.L.D. academy straight after he left high school, which [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKxoWoRH26Y Clark Gregg confirmed], around July 1982. He therefore would have progressed to become a Level 1 agent a few years later. In the following couple of decades at S.H.I.E.L.D., he progressed 6 levels. This would mean he progressed to Level 4 around the late 1990s, before progressing to Level 5 around the early 2000s, and so him being Level 4 in the flashbacks in 2003 fits, assuming he did not progress at exact regular intervals. It would likely be very soon before he reached Level 5.</ref><ref name="AoS414">''[[The Man Behind the Shield|Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 4.14: The Man Behind the Shield]]''</ref>

*Harold Meachum passes away after nearly 3 years battling cancer.<ref name="IF1 Harold Died 2004">Throughout February 2016, there are references to Harold's death. In ''[[Snow Gives Way]]'', Ward says it was "12 years ago". However, in ''[[The Mistress of All Agonies]]'', Dr. Paul Edmonds says Harold has "been dead for 13 years", in ''[[Bar the Big Boss]]'', Joy says, "I haven't had a dad for 13 years," and in ''[[Dragon Plays with Fire]]'', Harold says "I've had 13 years to plan this out," Joy says, "Dad has been held prisoner for 13 years," and Danny tells Harold, "You're going to prison. Only this time, it's gonna be nowhere near as nice as the one you spent the last 13 years in." Overall, the evidence points to his death being in late 2003 - "12 years" by rounding, but "13 years" by the common calculation of "2016 - 2003 = 13". However, [https://twitter.com/MarvelIronFist/status/842121466749452288 an official video revealed Harold died in 2004.] To make this fit as best as possible, Harold's death is dated to the first few days of 2004 - January 4th specifically - to be as close as possible to fitting best. This fits with Ward's statement that it was "12 years ago", and it can be assumed that all the news coverage for his illness was in the final months of 2003, and so others might remember it as being an event mainly in 2003, or just counting inclusively, for whatever reason referring to it as "13 years ago".<br>This fits with ''[[The Dragon Dies at Dawn]]'', when Joy says, "I believe it for the first 6 months. How about the next 12 years?" This suggests that 6 months after Harold's death was 12 years prior to Season 1 - July 2004 is indeed an approximate 12 years before February 2016.</ref><ref name="IF101"/><ref name="IF103"/><ref name="IF104"/><ref name="IF109"/><ref name="IF112"/><ref name="IF113"/>

[[File:TheIncredibleHulk snapshot 00.02.09.png|thumb|250px|Banner joins the [[Bio-Tech Force Enhancement Project]] at [[Culver University]]]]
*[[Bruce Banner]] joins the [[Bio-Tech Force Enhancement Project]] at [[Culver University]] at the insistence of his girlfriend [[Betty Ross]].<ref name="TIH Chase of Bruce Banner"/><ref name="TIHTBP"/>
*Betty's father, General [[Thaddeus Ross]] lies to the scientists on the project, claiming their work will help protect soldiers from depleted uranium.<ref name="TIH Chase of Bruce Banner">''[[The Incredible Hulk]]'', ''[[The Incredible Hulk: The Big Picture]]'', and ''[[The Incredible Hulk: The Fury Files]]'' provide evidence for the timeline of the Chase of Bruce Banner.
<br>In the film, it is shown that on "SUN 04/18/04" (April 18, 2004), Bruce is pictured on CCTV. ''The Incredible Hulk: The Big Picture'' shows on a calendar that Bruce got his powers on April 16, 2005. The film seems to suggest it is c. 2004 with the CCTV image from April 2004, and simultaneously suggests it is 2006 from the newspaper of the incident showing "-06". This April 2005 date fits nicely in the middle of these, as well as being a rounded "5 years" before November 25, 2009, "I am Iron Man", as shown on [[:File:Marvel-Movie-Universe.jpeg|Marvel's timeline]], and "5 years" before May-June 2010, the events of ''The Incredible Hulk'', as stated in the film and a deleted scene. The 2004 image is of Banner, not the Hulk, and so could be surveillance of him as he works on the project, and the 06 does not show the full "2006" and could be interpreted as an issue number, price, or something other. The 2005 date fits nicely and should be used. The comic shows that Bruce running away was "3 days" later, putting it on April 19, 2005, then shows that his next incident was on the Canadian border, on "05/19/05", May 19, 2005. It goes on to detail how this was followed by "months of nothing" where the "trail went cold," until the incident in "the heart of South America". Approximately 5 months would put this around October 18, 2005.
<br>There is then a gap from October 18, 2005-May 27, 2006 before the next location, which we know from the film included Bruce attempting contact on "02/07/06", February 7, 2006.
<br>The film shows that on "05/27/06" and "05/28/06", May 27-28, 2006, Bruce was sighted in Canada.
<br>There is then another gap from May 28, 2006-September 4, 2006.
<br>The film shows that on "09/04/06" (also accompanied by "2006"), September 4, 2006, there is an incident at a house, which seems to be placed on the map around Asia, roughly the Kyrgyzstan area, it does not actually show its exact position.
<br>There is another gap from September 4, 2006-January 22, 2007, in which on October 21, 2006 (shown on a letter) there was an unknown incident where Hulk fled the scene, the last sighting for at least 5 months.
<br>The film shows that on "01/22/07" (also accompanied by "2007"), so January 22, 2007, there was an incident ending in a crumpled car in Samara, Russia, which must not have actually been a sighting, just evidence left behind.
<br>There is then the final gap from January 22, 2007-April 12, 2010, in which a letter was written in March 2007 saying there had been no sightings for "5 months" since "October 21, 2006". The last time Bruce turned into the Hulk was on November 5, 2009, because the day after the ambush in Rio, which is on May 14, 2010, it can briefly be seen that before his counter reset that he had gone "190 days without incident".
<br>The film then begins on April 12, 2010, "158 days without incident," in Rocinha.
<br>There is a sighting in Dakota, which would make sense to fit when Bruce is travelling up from South America to Canada, in the October 18, 2005-May 27, 2006 gap. Based on the distances, Hulk being in Dakota in between these dates would fall around May 14, 2006.
<br>There is a sighting which is reported as a "Green sasquatch". Sites seem to believe this is the Canada sighting on May 28, 2006. There is a raid, which seems to follow on from the sighting in Canada image, so can also be assigned to Canada.
<br>In a deleted scene, corroborated by a piece of dialogue from ''The Avengers'', it is shown that Banner attempted suicide in the Arctic. This fits in the May 28, 2006-September 4, 2006 gap, just before the travel to Southeast Asia. There is a line on a map suggesting Banner travelled from Northwest Canada/the Arctic to Southeast Asia. This fits in the May 28, 2006-September 4, 2006 gap, following the incident in Canada. There are two dots suggesting Bruce was in Japan, which also fits in that gap, following the travel to Southeast Asia. The distances between each approximate location from Canada, to Nunavut, to Southeast Asia, to Sapporo, and then to roughly Kyrgyzstan between these dates would put Nunavut around June 7, 2006, Southeast Asia around August 2, 2006, and Sapporo around August 6, 2006.
<br>There is a "2006" incident with a truck, which can be assigned to the October 21, 2006 date, especially since it appears to be nearer to Europe from the company name helping the truck, which fits as Bruce is heading in the direction of Europe at that point. There is a "March 07" flight, which some sites have dated as March 2, 2007. This is presumably Bruce crossing the Atlantic to the U.S.A. Banner was in "the States" and encountered Nick Fury in ''The Incredible Hulk: The Fury Files''. It would make sense for this to be following the beginning of the Avenger Initiative in 2008, as given in ''Melinda''. In the film, there is a letter written by Fury from S.H.I.E.L.D., which can be assigned to just after this. A part where a military search highlighted on a map for which the latitude and longitude seems to suggest around Libya, fitting in this gap, before his final travel from Africa to South America. This travel is shown when military helicopters seem to be flying southwest from an African location (by latitude and longitude) toward South America, which we know was Bruce's final destination. It can be assumed that his last incident on November 5, 2009 was in South America, and is what led the military to follow across the Atlantic. The distances between each approximate location from Samara, to the U.S.A., to Libya, and then to east South America between these dates would put the U.S.A. around February 27, 2008 (although it seems to be a Saturday, because he is watching soccer, so March 1, 2008), which fits with the Avenger Initiative just starting up, and Libya around March 2, 2009.</ref><ref name="TIHTBP">''[[The Incredible Hulk: The Big Picture]]''</ref>

In ''[[War Without End]]'', Wing recognizes a story her mother used to tell her before she moved to the U.S., so she must have been at least 3 years old at the time of moving country.

Malus begins to explain what has happened, telling her that they have saved her through cutting edge genetic editing, including having to reconstruct her face in a different manner to how it looked before. He then reluctantly informs her of [[Brian Jones|Brian]] and [[Phillip Jones|Phillip]]'s deaths, which she begins to panic about. Malus assures her that [[Jessica Jones|Jessica]] survived, but she angrily demands to see her. He tells her she is doing fine, and Alisa's anger turns simply to mourning.<ref name="JJ207 April 2005 Placement">In ''[[AKA I Want Your Cray Cray]]'', it is said when Alisa Jones wakes that she has been at the facility for "5 years". She arrived on April 13, 2000 (see other references), making this approximately April 2005. Additionally, it is implied when she is next seen on June 27, 2005 (see other references) that she has been awake for no more than a month or so, only now following up on the conversation she had about Jessica when she woke and only now trying on a wig for the first time. Overall, this would make Alisa's waking approximately April/May 2005.<br>However, Jessica Jones is shown meeting Stirling Adams after, and then by June 27, 2005 she has started a relationship with him, dropped out of college, and they have moved in together, with Jones talking about how Adams has stuck around for her. This would usually take 6 months at a conservative estimate, suggesting Jones meeting Adams is around December 2004. However, on June 28, 2005, Jones has not seen Walker in "a month" and when she sees her again, it is news to her that Jones has a boyfriend, implying that them getting together happened in the last month, i.e. the last time they saw each other was in fact the scene shown, the evening she and Adams met - which would make that May 2005. However, it is possible that Jones simply did not tell Walker about Adams the last time they met. Still, Jones also describes the relationship as "recent", implying only a couple of months, starting no later than around April 2005. Overall, the evidence suggests this is around March 2005.<br>The evidence would place Alisa Jones waking as close as possible to April/May 2005, but Jessica Jones meeting Adams as close as possible to March 2005, so since Jessica meeting Adams occurs after, they can be taken to be the same day, as close as possible to each other to get as close as possible to their respective ideal placements. Therefore, the evidence can be taken as a whole.<br>April 13, 2000 being 5 years ago suggests approximately April 13, 2005. It only seemingly being maximum of about a month since Alisa Jones woke up on June 27, 2005 suggests not too much earlier than May 27, 2005. The progression of Jones and Adams' relationship suggests not too much later than December 27, 2004. Trish Walker not knowing suggests they met "a month" before June 28, 2005, so roughly May 28, 2005 if you take exactly, or just May 2005 if considering "June 2005 - 1 month = May 2005", the middle of which is May 16, 2005, overall approximately May 24, 2005 (putting more weight in the specifics). Finally, it being "recent" suggests not too much earlier than April 28, 2005.<br>The average of these five dates places the scenes on approximately April 12, 2005.</ref><ref name="JJ207"/>

The hottest time in New York is [https://www.holiday-weather.com/new_york_city/averages/ July and August], and when Jones and Walker sit on the rooftop together the day after Jones helps the children, there is a movie showing as in ''[[AKA Start at the Beginning]]'', when it is said that a movie plays on that roof on the "first Friday every month". Therefore, it should either be Friday, July 1, 2005 or Friday, August 5, 2005. July 1, 2005 makes the most sense, since 3 days prior Walker is asking Jones when they see each other for the first time in "a month" how her studies are going, and Jones informs her she has dropped out. Jones would not have been studying in the month from early July to early August if this were August 2, 2005 since it would be summer break from college - if it is June 28, 2005, however, it makes sense for Walker to ask about college, since there has been college term time since they last saw each other in May.<br>Alisa Jones finding Dorothy Walker and seeing Jessica does not appear to be the morning immediately following Alisa's escape and Jessica beating Wyatt, as Alisa needs time to find Dorothy Walker and Wyatt needs a short time to recover, so it can be taken that Alisa finding Walker is in fact the day after. So, Alisa Jones finding out about Jessica and subsequently escaping, while Jessica and Stirling Adams get closer and go to see Walker, then Alisa killing Adams and Walker talking to her the next day, all occurs from June 27, 2005 to July 1, 2005.</ref><ref name="JJ207"/>

Walker reassures her that Adams' death only happened because the men were killers, not because of anything she did, but Jones tells her she is also upset that Walker did not return her calls despite trying for 24 hours. She gets Walker to admit that she did not reply because she was high, and that she has become addicted and needs help, and Walker swears she will get help soon.

Because of this, after T'Challa narrates, "It's only a matter of time before war encroaches on innocent people", there is a necessary time gap placed in which 2½ years of fighting is assumed to occur, backed up by T'Challa's narration immediately after, saying, "The fighting goes on for so long, people lose sight of what they're fighting for." To make this gap as short as possible, the "10 years" is rounded to 9½ years, placing the opening scene around spring 2007.</ref>

Not a word from the feds, nothing from those Hallowe'en costume-wearing bozos up there over at Stark Tower. And then all of a sudden, this little bastard in red tights shows up, and he thinks he can tear down everything I've built." While this is almost certainly intended to refer to the "8 years" since the Battle of New York, as shown at the beginning of the film. However, this "8 years later" reference does not fit at all with the countless evidence stacked against it, putting ''[[The Avengers]]'' very firmly in 2012, and ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' very firmly in 2016. However, this piece of dialogue on its own can be interpreted as, "It's been 8 years since we started business, the number of heroes has grown and grown, but never has one intervened until now, until Spider-Man." 8 years before September 13, 2016, puts this around August 2008.

*[[Barack Obama]] is elected President of the United States.<ref name="MCU Presidency">
Presidential elections in the ''Marvel Cinematic Universe'' are not the same as in the real world. For a while it was never outright stated that Obama was president in the ''Marvel Cinematic Universe'', but implied from Tony's poster, designed to resemble Obama's, in ''[[Iron Man 2]]'', the Obama biography in ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'', and the repeated references to him in ''[[Luke Cage (TV series)|Luke Cage]]'', that Obama was likely president. Then in the ''[[Runaways (TV series)|Runaways]]'' episode ''[[Destiny]]'' it was confirmed, as Nico Minoru says, "You guys haven't had date night since the Obama Administration."<br>In December 2012, Aldrich Killian refers to President Ellis and says, "After years dodging the President's ban," implying Ellis has been president for years. Killian is also angry at Ellis' lack of involvement in the ''Norco'' incident, "2 years ago." It can also be assumed that Ellis was president when Steve woke in October 2011, as it is shown in ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'' that he is quoted as welcoming Steve back to the world.<br>In April 2015, Grant Ward says in ''[[A Fractured House]]'' that if his brother Christian were allowed to take him, his trial should then "wrap up right before the midterms". A newspaper in ''Captain America: Civil War'' also shows that it is an election year in 2016.
<br>From all of this, it can be assumed that, at least as of 2008, elections in the ''Marvel Cinematic Universe'' are every 2 years instead of every 4 years. Therefore, Obama would have been elected in November 2008. In May 2010, during Obama's presidency, Stark has a poster resembling Obama's. Ellis would have been elected in November 2010, and dealt with the December 2010 ''Norco'' incident and its aftermath as he came into his presidency. He would then have been president when Steve woke in October 2011, and in late December 2012, during ''Iron Man 3'', he would have been president for 2 years (just about fitting as "years"). Ellis would have been reelected in November 2014, and then the midterms would have been in November 2015, 7 months after Ward's statement. 2016 would then be the next election year, as shown in ''Captain America: Civil War''.</ref><ref name="LC111">''[[Now You're Mine|Luke Cage: 1.11: Now You're Mine]]''</ref><ref name="IM2"/><ref name="CATWS"/><ref name="R101"/><ref>''[[Rewind (Runaways)|Runaways: 1.02: Rewind]]''</ref><ref name="Lot 503"/>

However, the evidence for which years (if the explosion was 2007 and present 2015, explosion 2008 and present 2016, explosion 2009 and present 2017, explosion 2010 and present 2018) is extremely contradictory.<br>The total evidence for a February 2007 accident and February 2015 present events:
*In ''[[First Light]]'', security footage of Tyrone stealing the car radio says "2007-04-18". This does not match as any February, though is closest to February 2007.
*Jeph Loeb stated about the Marvel Television seasons released between April 27, 2018 and April 26, 2019, [https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/8pbxyk/im_jeph_loeb_head_of_marvel_tv_ama/e0a5ju5/ "For the most part our stories will take place BEFORE Thanos clicked his fingers,"] and later made more clear, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UqrlizXWIM&t=2015s "The short answer is that the stories that you're seeing, unless otherwise noted, all happen before <nowiki>[...]</nowiki> "the Thanos Snap". And we'll continue to be in that place until we find out what happens in ''Avengers 4'',"] Season 1 and the first half of Season 2 released in this period, meaning they are set before ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' in Spring/early Summer 2018. Since Season 2 takes place explicitly 8 months later in October, then it cannot be later than October 2017, making Season 1 February 2015, 2016, or 2017 - not 2018.
*In ''[[Call/Response]]'', a poster is up at the Wild Red Hawks for an event on "Friday, Jan. 30". January 30th was a Friday in 2015, though it could just be a much older poster left up for commemorative reasons.
The total evidence for a February 2008 accident and February 2016 present events:
*In ''First Light'', security footage of Tyrone stealing the car radio says "2007-04-18". This does not match as any February, though it would make most sense in-universe for it to be February 2008, with the camera clock set back several months by accident due to something like a reset.
*In ''[[Suicide Sprints]]'', Adina Johnson's vision shows the "missing" dates of her children as being "6/6/08". The closest February is 2008, and this would make sense, for her to still be very anxious about a second child dying 4 months later, and the 6/6/08 actually being the date of her anxiety rather than the date of Billy's death.
*In ''Call/Response'', ''[[Shadow Selves]]'', and ''[[Rabbit Hold]]'', it is shown in obituaries that Billy Johnson was born on "August 1, 1990" and died aged "17", with another obituary in ''[[Princeton Offense]]'' also saying he was 17. If he were born in August 1990, the February where he was 17 would have been 2008.
*In ''Princeton Offense'', Peter Scarborough's Wikipedia page says, "In 2009, after supervising the Roxxon cleanup effort in New Orleans following an oil rig explosion, Scarborough transitioned to a consulting position." This could potentially work with the accident being February 2008, with cleanup in 2008 and then Scarborough moving on in early 2009.
*Jeph Loeb's statement as mentioned.
*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9d8dOY7e58&t=1382s Emma Lahana says this is O'Reilly's first case in New Orleans]. Nandi Tyler says in ''[[Luke Cage (TV series)|Luke Cage]]'': [[Luke Cage (TV series)/Season Two|Season 2]], Episode 8 - ''[[If It Ain't Rough, It Ain't Right]]'', set in August 2017, that O'Reilly has moved to New Orleans. In ''[[Ghost Stories]]'', O'Reilly mentions events involving superheroes with her friend Misty Knight in New York, meaning it is after ''Luke Cage'': [[Luke Cage (TV series)/Season One|Season 1]] in December 2015. If she moved in February 2016, this fits within this range, though it is implied that O'Reilly left during Knight's time away from the force, which would not work with February 2016 since her time off begins in May 2016.
*In ''First Light'', a taxi is shown with a "11 17" registration sticker, meaning it should be between November 2015 and November 2017.
*In ''[[Funhouse Mirrors]]'', Stan Bartlett's license plate says "18". This means that if he just renewed it in the last several weeks, it could be February 2016, with an expiry date in early 2018.
The total evidence for a February 2009 accident and February 2017 present events:
*In ''First Light'', Nathan Bowen's work ID is valid from "30MAR08" to "29MAR10".
*In ''Suicide Sprints'', Adina Johnson's vision shows Tyrone's date of birth as "8/19/00", although Billy's says "02" which is definitely not his real year of birth, so it can be taken that this is not reliable either. In ''Call/Response'', Season 1, Episode 4, Tyrone say, "My parents look at me like a liar and a thief ever since I was 8. They don't trust me. Not really. You know, ever since that night." If his birthday is indeed August 19, 2000, then the February where he was 8 would be February 2009.
*Peter Scarborough's Wikipedia page, as mentioned above, supports 2009 more than it does 2008.
*In ''Princeton Offense'', the oil rig schematics are shown to have been on "9/10/2008", suggesting the accident was after September 10, 2008.
*Jeph Loeb's statement as mentioned.
*As mentioned, Emma Lahana says this is O'Reilly's first case in New Orleans and O'Reilly is still in New York in December 2015 but in New Orleans by August 2017. If she moved in February 2017, this is the only February that fits perfectly since it implied that O'Reilly left during Knight's time away from the force, which began in May 2016.
*The "11 17" taxi registration sticker as mentioned.
*In ''First Light'', Tyrone has a leaflet for [https://thetvshows.us/displayimage.php?album=2594&pid=3028413#top_display_media "FREE COMIC BOOK DAY 1st Saturday in May - May 6, 2017"], which would work in February 2017.
*As mentioned, there is an (unreliable) August 2000 date of birth given for Tyrone in ''Suicide Sprints''. In the same episode, Tyrone mentions that he has known Father Delgado for 3 years, which would suggests he is in February of junior year, meaning he was born 16.4-17.4 years ago, so since it is an August and date of birth and currently February, he would be 16.5. 16.5 years after August 2000 gives February 2017.
*In ''Call/Response'', a magazine says, "Currently chairs a committee in 2017."
*Stan Bartlett's license plate as mentioned says "18", which means it is between 2016 and 2018.
*In ''[[Colony Collapse]]'', on Mardi Gras, Scarborough references the surname Rand being a name that means you are known to be rich currently, implying Season 1, Episode 10: The Rands are referred to, suggesting Danny Rand is back in the world. Mardi Gras in 2016 was February 6th, before Danny Rand has returned, so it does not fit with 2016, but would make it February 2017 or 2018.
*The basketball state finals occur days before Mardi Gras. The basketball state finals in Louisiana tend to be early March, and 2017 is the year where Mardi Gras is as close as possible to this, on February 28th.
The total evidence for a February 2010 accident and February 2018 present events:
*Nathan Bowen's work ID as mentioned.
*The oil rig schematic revisions as mentioned.
*In ''First Light'', ''Lush Life'' by Leo Islo plays in-universe. This song was put online on March 27, 2017, so the only possible February is 2018.
*In ''First Light'', ''Right Now'' by Vindata plays in-universe. This song was put online on February 22, 2017. This is just 12 days too late to fit with February 2017, so the only possible February is 2018.
*Tyrone has a "FREE COMIC BOOK DAY 1st Saturday in May - May 6, 2017" leaflet as mentioned, which could work with 2018 if you assume he just left it up for several months after.
*In ''Suicide Sprints'', Adina Johnson has the book ''Grief Cottage'', which was released August 2017, so the only possible February is 2018.
*As mentioned, there is an (unreliable) August 2000 date of birth given for Tyrone in ''Suicide Sprints''. In ''Rabbit Hold'', it is shown on a poster and stated that Tyrone is "18". The October where he would be 18 would be October 2018, making Season 1 February 2018.
*In ''Princeton Offense'', O'Reilly looks at narcotics arrest files that she describes as being from "about 8 years ago", and the files on screen are from "02/18/2010", suggesting this is February 2018.
*In ''Princeton Offense'', news stories from "hours ago" are real life news stories from September 2017. This does not work for any February, though if it has to suggest one it would be February 2018, because at least those stories have happened by then.
*Stan Bartlett's license plate as mentioned says "18", which works so long as the plate was registered between February and December 2016.
*In ''Ghost Stories'', Tyrone's phone says "Thursday, October 5". October 5th was a Thursday in 2017, and was the day of filming. This does not work for any February, though if it has to suggest one it would be February 2018, because it is more likely if the phone has the wrong date that it would be a past date, not a future one, if the phone was accidentally reset or something similar.
*Scarborough's reference to the Rands as mentioned.
*In ''[[Alignment Chart]]'', an obituary for Kenneth Fuchs says, "Fuchs, aged 32, passed away on February 11, 2018."
Overall, when weighing up the value of each piece of evidence and the specificity and making compromises, February 2009/2017 comes out as the strongest option.</ref><ref name="C&D108">''[[Ghost Stories|Cloak & Dagger: 1.08: Cloak & Dagger]]''</ref>

As detailed in [[:File:Marvel-Movie-Universe.jpeg|Marvel's official 2012 ''The Art of The Avengers'' timeline]], ''Iron Man'' spans 9 months from Tony's kidnapping to "I am Iron Man", then ''Iron Man 2'' is 6 months later. With Tony's birthday appearing in ''Iron Man 2'', which is May 29th (as shown on a [[:File:The Avengers Deleted Scene - Tony Stark File.png|file]] in a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pov4qMSfg9w deleted scene] from ''[[The Avengers]]'' and on [[:File:USC Avengers Props Exhibition.jpg|official display at an event]], and lines up with other evidence placing the film in May), ''Iron Man 2'' is set mostly in May, and ''Iron Man'' is February-November of the year before, which also lines up with its own evidence. However, the evidence for which years they are set in is contradictory.<br>A 2008 setting for ''Iron Man'' is implied by:
*A date on a TV in ''Iron Man'' which says "May 4, 2008".
*Vision's line from ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'', firmly on June 19, 2016, saying, "In the 8 years since Mr. Stark announced himself as Iron Man."
*A statement from Kevin Feige ([https://moviepilot.com/p/kevin-feige-peter-parker-mcu-origin-spider-man-homecoming/4234700 1], [http://www.aintitcool.com/node/77511 2]) implying 4 years between ''Iron Man'' and ''The Avengers'', which is firmly set in May 2012.
However, a 2009 setting for ''Iron Man'' is implied by:
*[[:File:Marvel-Movie-Universe.jpeg|Marvel's official timeline]] showing that "I am Iron Man" is 67 years after March 1942 (date [[:File:Tonsberg, Norway - March 1942.png|shown on-screen]] in ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]''), when Schmidt took the Tesseract, 67 years after June 22, 1943 (date [[:File:Nazis in New York.png|given by newspaper]] in ''Captain America: The First Avenger'' and [https://www.instagram.com/p/BG-WGtcr3Ub confirmed by Marvel]), when Steve went through Project Rebirth, 64 years after early February 1945 (date given by [http://www.icollector.com/Leaked-telegram-from-Col-Phillips_i12119993 auctioned prop from ''Captain America: The First Avenger''] and supported by [[:File:Rogers Disappears.jpg|newspaper in ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'' from a while after the disappearance]], as well as [[:File:Lovely picture.PNG|Reinhardt's arrest date a while after Red Skull's death, shown in ''The Things We Bury'']] - all explained in [[1940s]] references), when Steve went into the ice, meaning the timeline overall presents late 2009 for "I am Iron Man".
*Jon Watts saying that [http://www.pressreader.com/australia/empire-australasia/20170701/281513636097609 "the eight-year-old Peter had seen Stark say, 'I am Iron Man,' on TV,"] and [https://www.comicbookmovie.com/spider-man/homecoming/spider-man-homecoming-director-jon-watts-says-iron-man-was-always-part-of-the-film-a152207 again that Peter was 8 at that moment], with the fact that Peter was born in early 2001 (from [http://time.com/4312912/captain-america-civil-war-stephen-mcfeely-christopher-markus/ him being 15 in ''Captain America: Civil War''], June 2016, and "15" in ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'', September 2016, as well as [http://newyorkschooltalk.org/2016/10/nyc-give-parents-flexibility-kindergarten-start-dates/ a New York sophomore in 2016-17, meaning he was born in 2001]).
*''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.|Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'': [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D./Season Two|Season 2]], Episode 17 - ''[[Melinda]]'', set firmly in April 2015 in the lead-up to ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (see [[2015]] references), flashing back to "7 years ago" when the Avengers Initiative was just starting up, seemingly a while before ''Iron Man''.
A pre-2010 (2008 or 2009) setting is implied by:
*In ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', when Ultron scrolls through images, a [[:File:AAoU - FEB-12-2010.png|"FEB/12/2010"]] photo is shown of the Mark I armour. The photo could have been taken any time after the Mark I was made, but since the Mark I was only completed in May, this means it cannot be later than May 2009.
*In ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', when Ultron scrolls through images, an old "news archive" story about Iron Man is shown from [[:File:AAoU - 20.07.10.jpg|"20.07.10"]], including footage of him in Gulmira. This means that the Battle of Gulmira, in November of its year, can be no later than November 2009, for a news report from July 2010 to feature footage from it.
The second half of ''Iron Man 2'', the events of ''Thor'', and the second half of ''The Incredible Hulk'' are all set in the same week, known as "Fury's Big Week", as detailed in the ''[[The Avengers Prelude: Fury's Big Week]]'' comic, on Marvel's timeline, and shown in the films. ''Iron Man 2'' also cannot span more than a few weeks, because:
*The Expo is said to only be a year long, and there is "362 days left" on the day of Pepper's hiring and "343 days left" on the day of the Battle at Stark Expo.
*Tony jokes that Pepper has only been CEO for "a week" after the Expo fight. Although the "days left" just mentioned shows it has been 19 days, still, it cannot be any longer.
*The Monaco incident, which is after Pepper's hiring, is shown on [[:File:Marvel-Movie-Universe.jpeg|Marvel's timeline]] to still be 6 months after "I am Iron Man", when the senate meeting ''before'' her hiring is also said by Hammer to be "6 months" after the end of ''Iron Man'' and the Expo opening before ''that'' is shown to be "6 months later" (confirmed by Jon Favreau in DVD commentary to refer to the time since "I am Iron Man"). So, the Monaco incident is definitely within a month of the Expo opening.
*The inspired canon ''[[The Avengers: Iron Man Mark VII]]'' comic shows that the ice problem test flight in ''Iron Man'' is on or after "Day 1", that the fight in Monaco is between "Day 189" and "Day 199", and that the Battle at Stark Expo in Fury's Big Week is before "Day 199", meaning that the end of ''Iron Man 2'' is still just over 6 months maximum after.
*The rate at which Tony's palladium poisoning is increasing means that the film cannot realistically span more than a few weeks anyway.
A 2010 setting is implied for Fury's Big Week by:
*The [https://web.archive.org/web/20100420085102/http://www.starkexpo2010.com/ ''Stark Expo 2010'' website] saying that the Expo - the first Expo since 1974, the same one shown in the film - begins on "May 7th 2010".
*A letter on the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100420085102/http://www.starkexpo2010.com/ ''Stark Expo 2010'' website] also saying that the Expo begins on "May 7th . 2010".
*A computer in ''Iron Man 2'' saying "05.06.10".
*The Grand Prix de Monaco Historique appearing in ''Iron Man 2'', which is a biannual event which was held in May 2010.
*Blonsky being known to have been born on "March 1, 1971", as said in a deleted scene, and saying in ''The Incredible Hulk'' that he is "39".
*Fury saying Steve slept for "almost 70 years" in ''Captain America: The First Avenger'', Steve saying he slept for "70 years" in ''The Avengers'', and then more specific with "65 years" in ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' - overall implying he slept for about 66½-66¾ years. And, having gone into the ice in February 1945, this therefore implying he woke around late 2011, and ''The Avengers Prelude: Fury's Big Week'' shows that this is "one year later" after the end of Fury's Big Week.
*Tony Stark's file, on [[:File:USC Avengers Props Exhibition.jpg|display at an event]] and [[:File:The Avengers Deleted Scene - Tony Stark File.png|shown in a deleted scene from ''The Avengers'']], saying he was CEO of Stark Industries until 2010.
*Natasha saying to Bruce on May 2, 2012, "You've been more than a year without an incident. I don't think you wanna break that streak," when we know he had incidents in Harlem, then a month later in British Columbia (both in ''The Incredible Hulk''), and those incidents were in June and July respectively, meaning they cannot be 2011.
*The ''[[Iron Man 3 Prelude]]'' showing that 10 months before ''The Avengers'', in July 2011, enough time had passed since ''Iron Man 2'' that all of the damage at the Expo had been cleaned up, Stark Tower had been fully planned, the foundations had been laid, and the first few levels had already been constructed.
However, a 2011 setting for Fury's Big Week is implied by:
*Fury saying on May 4, 2012 in ''The Avengers'', "Last year, Earth had a visitor from another planet who had a grudge match that levelled a small town," implying the Battle of Puente Antiguo was last year.
*The ''[[Thor: The Dark World Prelude]]'' comic showing Darcy, on May 4, 2012, saying to Jane that "it's been a year", implying it has been a year since Thor left.
*Darcy saying in ''Thor: The Dark World'', "He's gonna come back. Except, you know, last time he was gone for like, 2 years," seemingly referring to it being 2 years from him leaving Jane before he returned on November 11, 2013 (but potentially just meaning, "Last time he left you, it was 2 years before he returned to Earth," referring to ''The Avengers'').
*The 2011 song ''Walk'' by Foo Fighters playing in a bar which Thor and Selvig visit during ''Thor''.
Fury's Big Week is 6 months after "I am Iron Man". This is shown from:
*Justin Hammer saying in ''Iron Man 2'', "We all know why we're here. In the last 6 months, Anthony Stark has created a sword with untold possibilities."
*Marvel's timeline showing that both the Ambush in Rio de Janeiro (which is shown in ''The Incredible Hulk'' to be "17 days" before Banner arrived at Culver University on Day 3 of Fury's Big Week) and the Duel of Monaco (which is days before Fury's Big Week) were 6 months after "I am Iron Man".
*''Iron Man 2'' beginning with "I am Iron Man" and showing a montage of Vanko working, then showing "6 months later", the Stark Expo opening. Jon Favreau confirmed on the DVD commentary that the Vanko montage covers the 6 months, with "6 months later" referring to the time since "I am Iron Man".
*Pepper joking in Monaco that Christine Everhart slept with Tony "last year" (which was 9 months before "I am Iron Man").
*The inspired canon ''The Avengers: Iron Man Mark VII'' comic showing about 197 days between the test flight with the icing problem and the Battle at Stark Expo.
So, ''Iron Man'' is set in February-November of 2008 or 2009, Fury's Big Week is set in May-June of 2010 or 2011, and Fury's Big Week is 6 months after "I am Iron Man".<br>The best solution possible, to satisfy the most evidence with the most importance, is reasoned out as ''Iron Man'' being set from February-November 2009 and Fury's Big Week being set in May-June 2010.

While this full date is impossible (see other references) following evidence putting it in 2009, the May 4th part of the date works, if simply applied to 2009 (the best-fitting year for the events of ''Iron Man'') instead of 2008 - like in ''Iron Man 3'', where the prop date is right, but the year is one off. Tony's return from Afghanistan in May 2009 revolves around this May 4th date.</ref><ref name="IM"/><ref name="TAIMMVII">''[[The Avengers: Iron Man Mark VII]]''</ref><ref name="IMSM"/><ref name="IMLE"/>

*Stark starts a new log about his armors, beginning a new "Day 1". He recounts his escape from Afghanistan, before beginning his first test of the newly-completed Mark II armor.<ref name="IM/IM2/T/TIH 2009-10 Placements"/><ref name="TAIMMVII Days">The ''[[The Avengers: Iron Man Mark VII]]'' comic shows that its "Day 189" is just before Tony leaves for the Grand Prix de Monaco Historique, and "Day 199" is a little while after the Battle at Stark Expo. With the Grand Prix dated to May 23, 2010 (see other references), this would imply that "Day 189" is May 22, 2010, fitting with "Day 199" being June 1, 2010, the day after the battle. This would then put "Day 1", shown to be the day of the test flight with the icing problem, on November 15, 2009, which lines up perfectly with the fact that ''[[Iron Man (film)|Iron Man]]'' presents the party the following day as being November 16, 2009, and then "I am Iron Man" being November 25, 2009 (see other references). The comic does contain recounts of the Battle of Gulmira and the Duel of Los Angeles on "Day 23" and "Day 30" respectively, but unlike with the test flight and the Duel of Monaco, shown actually playing out, they only appear as recounts. Because of the strong evidence putting the films in their November and May placements, this should not affect the timeline, but instead just be considered as Tony recounting those events during December, allowing the timeline to work out perfectly.</ref><ref name="IM November Placement">In ''[[Iron Man (film)|Iron Man]]'', the second half of the film is set over several days in November 2009. This comes from the fact that on the day of the senate meeting in ''Iron Man 2'', May 8, 2010, it is said to have been 6 months since Iron Man surfaced, and [[:File:Marvel-Movie-Universe.jpeg|Marvel's timeline]] shows that the Ambush in Rio de Janeiro, May 14, 2009, and the Duel of Monaco, May 23, 2010, are 6 months since "I am Iron Man". Together, these three would put "I am Iron Man" around November 15, 2009. At the party where Tony dances with Pepper and Tony discovers Obadiah has gone behind his back, Coulson arranges a meeting for "the 24th." He then shows up for the meeting as Pepper escapes with the USB with Obadiah's information, the day of the Duel of Los Angeles. "I am Iron Man" is the day after, putting it on the 25th of its month. The closest 25th to November 15, 2009 is November 25, 2009, which also works as 6 months before May 2010 by the general math of "November 2009 + 6 months = May 2010". The party scene has to be within October 25-November 22, 2009, as these are the only dates on which Coulson simply saying "the 24th" fits as November 24th. On the night of the party, Tony checks his watch before he leaves. While it does not give a month, it shows the date as Thursday 16th. The Thursday might not line up, but the 16th lines up perfectly, being November 16th. This lines up perfectly with the ''The Avengers: Iron Man Mark VII'' comic. It has been established that its "Day 189" was May 22, 2010, as Tony left for Monaco, and its "Day 199" was June 1, 2010, the day after the Battle at Stark Expo. This would put its "Day 1", which is shown to be the day of the test flight, on November 15, 2009, lining up as the day before the party on the 16th, as it presented in the film.</ref><ref name="TAIMMVII"/><ref name="IM"/>

This can be taken as specifically around February 25, 2010, or more generally as "February 2010 - November 2009 = 3 months", meaning any point in February 2010, approximately February 14-15, 2010.
