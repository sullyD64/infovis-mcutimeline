*[[Malcolm Ducasse]] is born.<ref>In ''[[AKA Start at the Beginning]]'', Jessica Jones says to Malcolm Ducasse that if her brother Phillip had lived, "He would've been your age." Phillip was born c. February 1990 (see other references), making Ducasse's date of birth c. February 1990. Eka Darville's age at the times of filming ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]'': [[Jessica Jones (TV series)/Season One|Season 1]], ''[[The Defenders]]'': [[The Defenders/Season One|Season 1]], and ''Jessica Jones'': [[Jessica Jones (TV series)/Season Two|Season 2]], working back from the times of filming, would place Ducasse's date of birth a little earlier, around February 1989, so it can be assumed that due to the slight leniency of the comment, Ducasse is slightly older than Phillip Jones, born around January 1990.</ref><ref name="JJ201">''[[AKA Start at the Beginning|Jessica Jones: 2.01: AKA Start at the Beginning]]''</ref>

His date of death is April 13, 2000 (see [[2000s]] references), meaning he was born between January 1, 1990 and April 13, 1990, making his date of birth approximately February 1990.</ref><ref name="JJ201" />

With his date of birth approximated to April 1980 (see [[1980s]] references), specifically April 11, 1980, this can be taken as roughly May 11, 1990.</ref><ref name="LC110">''[[Take It Personal|Luke Cage: 1.10: Take It Personal]]''</ref><ref name="LC207">''[[On and On|Luke Cage: 2.07: On and On]]''</ref>

*[[Hale]] wakes up in the [[HYDRA Preparatory Academy]] and prepares for the day.<ref name="AoS515 1990 Placement">In ''[[Rise and Shine]]'', events with Hale at the HYDRA Preparatory Academy are shown to be "28 years ago" before Spring/early Summer 2018. The "2 years ago" scenes in the episode show Ruby Hale reaching the same stage in her education on April 26, 2016, so it would make sense if it were the same time of year for her mother - the last Tuesday of April, so April 24, 1990.</ref><ref name="AoS515">''[[Rise and Shine|Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 5.15: Rise and Shine]]''</ref>

[[File:Whitehall students.png|thumb|250px|Whitehall gives a speech to [[HYDRA]] students]]
*Whitehall gives a lecture to Hale's class, talking about how they are finding a new way to replicate the super soldier effect of the process performed on [[Steve Rogers]], but are missing a key component. Hale's classmate [[Wolfgang von Strucker]] suggests they try to acquire the [[Tesseract]], but Whitehall is impressed when Hale instead suggests looking to space for answers.<ref name="AoS515 1990 Placement" /><ref name="AoS515" />

[[File:YoungHaleMeetingWithWhitehall.jpg|thumb|250px|Hale being brought before [[Daniel Whitehall]]]]
*Hale is taken to see Daniel Whitehall, who explains that since she is the only girl graduating, she is the only one capable of a special task they wish to assign her. He tells her that she will infiltrate the air force and that they will artificially inseminate her with a child designed to be optimized for particle infusion. Hale is angry that her talents will be wasted, but reluctantly accepts.<ref name="AoS515 1990 Placement" /><ref name="AoS515" />

====21st====
*[[Mariah Dillard]] meets 12-year-old [[Raymond Jones]].<ref>In ''[[All Souled Out]]'', Mariah Dillard says she has known Piranha Jones since he was "12 years old". With his date of birth approximated to November 1977 (see [[1970s]] references), specifically November 20, 1977, the middle of Jones' time as a 12-year-old (as an approximation for when he met Dillard) would be May 21, 1990.</ref><ref name="LC205"/>

====24th====
*[[Alexander Pierce]] and [[Nick Fury]] meet.<ref>In ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'', Alexander Pierce says that the photo he is holding "was taken 5 years after Nick and [he] met". The photo being taken is dated to approximately May 12, 1995 (see other references), so this would suggest approximately May 12, 1990 for when they met. However, it may more roughly just mean "1995 - 1990 = 5", so any time in 1990 (using mid-21990 as an approximation). Putting more weight in the specific date than just the year, a weighted calculation gives roughly May 24, 1990 for when they met.</ref><ref name="CATWS">''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]''</ref>

===August===
*[[Davos]] is born.<ref>In ''[[Heart of the Dragon]]'', the credits say the flashback Danny Rand and Davos are "13 year old Danny" and "13 year old Davos". Similarly, in ''[[A Duel of Iron]]'', they are credited as "12 Year Old Danny" and "12 Year Old Davos". This means that Rand and Davos overlap in age. In ''[[The Fury of Iron Fist]]'', Davos calls Rand "little brother", so he is older. With Rand born on April 1, 1991 (see other references), this means Davos was born between April 2, 1990 and April 1, 1991. With Sacha Dhawan's ages at the times of filming ''[[Iron Fist (TV series)|Iron Fist]]'': [[Iron Fist (TV series)/Season One|Season 1]] and [[Iron Fist (TV series)/Season Two|Season 2]], working back from the settings, his age would suggest Davos being born closer to 1983, so this would imply that Davos was born closer to April 2, 1990 than April 1, 1991. It can be calculated that he was born roughly around August 1990.</ref>

====2nd====
*The {{WPS|Gulf War}} begins.<ref name="Real Events" /><ref name="AAoU">''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''</ref>

===September===
*[[Mina Hess]] is born.<ref>Ally Maki's age at the times of filming ''[[Cloak & Dagger]]'': [[Cloak & Dagger/Season One|Season 1]] and [[Cloak & Dagger/Season Two|Season 2]], working back from the February-March 2017 and October-November 2017 setting dates, would suggest Mina Hess was born around April 1985 and is 31-32 in present events. However, Hannah Hardin's age at the time of filming ''[[Lotus Eaters]]'', working back from the February 2009 setting, would suggest Mina Hess was born around May 1993 and is 15 in the flashback. Taking a weighted average, overall Mina Hess' date of birth can be placed around September 1990, making her 18 in the flashback and 26-27 in present events.</ref>

===October===
*[[Joy Meachum]] is born.<ref name="IF1 Joy Meachum DoB">In ''[[The Blessing of Many Fractures]]'', while discussing "that last summer in the Hamptons with Dad," Joy says, "I was 12 years old." This last summer would have been July 2003, before Harold's reasoned death date of January 2004. In ''[[Rolling Thunder Cannon Punch]]'', Joy says, "I was 13 when Dad died." If she was 12 in July 2003, but 13 in January 2004, this implies she turned 13 around October 2003, making her date of birth approximately October 1990.</ref>

===November===
*[[Sean Miller]] is born.<ref>In ''[[The H Word]]'', it is said that Sean Miller was 25 when he died. With his death dated to May 2016, his date of birth would be approximately November 1990.</ref><ref name="TD101">''[[The H Word|The Defenders: 1:01: The H Word]]''</ref>

===January===
====4th====
*[[Benjamin Donovan]] formally becomes the Stokes family's lawyer.<ref>In ''[[If It Ain't Rough, It Ain't Right]]'', it is said on August 30, 2017 (see [[2017]] references) that "Ben Donovan has been the lawyer for the Stokes family for over 25 years". This cannot refer to the mid-1980s flashback in ''[[The Creator]]'', as this is over 30 years before 2017, so he must have just been formally hired as their regular lawyer at a later date. "Over 25 years" would suggest somewhere between late 1989 and early 1992, and can overall be approximated to January 4, 1991.</ref><ref>''[[If It Ain't Rough, It Ain't Right|Luke Cage: 2.08: If It Ain't Rough, It Ain't Right]]''</ref>

*[[Danny Rand]] is born.<ref name="IF101">''[[Snow Gives Way|Iron Fist: 1.01: Snow Gives Way]]''</ref><ref name="IF1 Danny Rand DoB">In ''[[Snow Gives Way]]'', Danny says he was "born on April 1st." Danny says in ''Snow Gives Way'', "I was 10 when we crashed," as well as Claire saying in ''[[The Blessing of Many Fractures]]'' that he "must've been a pretty gangsta 10-year-old," while looking at his iPod from before the crash. This would mean his year of birth would be 1991. This fits what is said by Ward Meachum in ''[[Shadow Hawk Takes Flight]]'', that Danny is in his "mid-20s," he would be 24 going on 25, and in ''[[Rolling Thunder Cannon Punch]]'', where Danny's grave shows his birth year as "199-" with the last number obscured.</ref>

With his birthday reasoned to be around late October 1980, this would put him learning to pilot the ship at around late April 1991.</ref>

*10-year-old [[Ray Nadeem]] looks up to a local man named Jack Kem, known to everyone as "[[Jiggy]]". He lives in a two-family house by himself and helps people around the block, and Nadeem sees him as a hero. However, as Jiggy seemingly helps people, he hides heroin in the their homes. When the police track it down, they arrest the innocent people he has framed instead of him.<ref>In ''[[Aftermath]]'', Ray Nadeem says Jiggy's activities in his neighborhood were when he was a "10-year-old". With Nadeem's date of birth approximated to December 1980 (see [[1980s]] references), the middle of his time as a 10-year-old (as an approximation for this) would have been roughly June 1991.</ref>

Based on a weighted average working with this information, Anson Mount, Serinda Swan, Eme Ikwuakor, Iwan Rheon, and Isabelle Cornish's ages at the middle of filming for ''Inhumans'': Season 1, working back from when it is set, as well as Lofton Show, Aidan Fiske, and Leila Bootsma's ages at the middle of filming for the show, the characters' dates of birth would be Black Bolt around October 1982, Medusa around April 1983, Gorgon around May 1985, Maximus around June 1985, and Crystal around September 1991, with Black Bolt and Medusa meeting when Medusa is nearly 14½ and Black Bolt is about to turn 15, in September 1997.

*King [[T'Chaka]] travels to [[Oakland]], [[California]] to visit his undercover brother, [[N'Jobu]], having received evidence that N'Jobu assisted [[Ulysses Klaue]] when he [[Attack on Wakanda|attacked Wakanda]].<ref name="BP 1990s">In ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'', on July 1, 2016 (see references on [[2016]]), [[T'Challa]] says that [[Ulysses Klaue]] "escaped our pursuits for almost 30 years". [[W'Kabi]] later says, "For 30 years your father was in power and did nothing," referring to Klaue, and to the time that spanned between his attack and [[T'Chaka]]'s death, dated to June 22, 2016. As well as this, W'Kabi says in a [https://www.comicbookmovie.com/black_panther/black-panther-deleted-scene-features-a-husband-and-wife-confrontation-between-okoye-and-wkabi-a160180 deleted scene], on July 4, 2016, that when it comes to Klaue, for "30 years, there's been no justice". While these pieces of dialogue would imply the attack was around 1987, the film also shows scenes set in "1992" which depict the attack as having been recent. Weighted calculations from all the evidence and factors gives April 24, 1989 as the approximate best-fitting date for the attack, and January 15, 1992 as the approximate best-fitting date for the "1992" scenes.

[[File:Janet-Victor-Runaways1.07.png|250px|thumb|Victor Stein meeting [[Janet Stein|Janet]] in class at [[Culver University]]]]
*At [[Culver University]], a student named [[Victor Stein]] meets a student named [[Janet Stein|Janet]] as they watch a live video feed of a sunset in Mauna Kea, [[Hawaii]] in a lecture. Stein says that the atmospheric refraction of the sunset showing us light that has already fallen behind the horizon is the key to looking at time travel, observing things at a time different to when they are actually occurring. They would soon begin a relationship, eventually leading to their marriage.<ref>In ''[[Refraction]]'', it it shown that Victor Stein and Janet met "25 years ago" before December 2017, making it late 1992. It is 18:41 and sunset in Mauna Kea, and the two times in the year when sunset in Mauna Kea is 18:41 are around April 20th and August 26th each year. Therefore, it is most likely August 26, 1992. However, in the scene, one other student says to another, "Dude, have you seen ''Reservoir Dogs'' yet?" ''Reservoir Dogs'' got its limited release in the U.S. on October 23, 1992, so this scene has to be after then - the phrasing implying at least a couple of days. Therefore, the earliest possible this scene can be is October 25, 1992. This earliest possible date should be used for it to be as close as possible to the August 26th date for the sunset, so the scene is dated to October 25, 1992.</ref><ref name="R107" />

*[[Jack Murdock]] returns home after a boxing match and finds his son [[Daredevil|Matt]] asleep. He wakes him up and allows him to feel his face for his injuries. He then tells Matt to finish his homework.<ref name="DD1 1990s Placements">In ''[[Stick (episode)|Stick]]'', on January 30, 2015 (see [[2015]] references), Matt Murdock says to Stick that he has been gone for "20 years", suggesting he left Murdock around early 1995. In the flashbacks in ''[[Kinbaku]]'', on October 29, 2005 (See [[2000s]] references), Murdock tells Elektra Natchios that his father died "10 years" ago, suggesting that he died around late 1995. However, Jack Murdock died a couple of months before Stick met Matt, which was another several months before he left Matt. If there is around 8 months between Jack's death and Stick leaving Matt, working from the midpoint between these two suggestions, mid-1995, 4 months either way would suggest that Jack died around early 1995 and Stick left Matt around late 1995. However, the subtitles of ''[[Cut Man]]'' [https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Thread:241334#106 show Creel vs. Murdock to be November 12th], so it can be shifted to the nearest November: November 12, 1994. This lines up with the fact that the poster in the episode shows it to be a Saturday, with November 12, 1994 being a Saturday. Matt and Stick can then be approximated as meeting around 2 months later, January 12, 1995, and Stick leaving Matt a further 6 months later, July 12, 1995.</ref><ref name="DD101"/>

*[[Alexander Pierce]] is in State Department in [[Bogotá]] when ELN rebels take the embassy. Security get Pierce out, but the rebels take hostages.<ref name="CATWS Bogotá">In ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'', Alexander Pierce tells the story of Fury saving the hostages in Bogotá, and explains that he gave him a promotion afterward. The implication is that this was when Fury was promoted to Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.. As well as this, in the photograph he is holding from then, Fury looks not much younger than he does in the present, 2014 events, suggesting perhaps a 2000s setting, and Fury says in ''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]'', in June 1995 (see other references), that he has had a desk job for "the past 6 years", implying that this operation should not be between mid-1989 and June 1995. However, Fury loses his eye in ''Captain Marvel'', in June 1995, and has two eyes in Pierce's photograph. He cannot be trying a glass eye in the photograph, as he is shown in ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'' to still have the scarred eye in the socket, so the photograph must be before June 1995, before ''Captain Marvel''. Considering he looks older than he does in that film, it should be as late as possible. Fury is bald in the photograph, but has short hair in ''Captain Marvel'', so the photograph needs to be at least a month before ''Captain Marvel'' for him to grow the hair. Placing the photograph as late as possible, a month before his appearance in ''Captain Marvel'', it can be approximated to May 12, 1995. The Bogotá operation is presumably about a week earlier, so can be approximated to May 5, 1995. It can be assumed that Fury being Deputy Chief of the station in Bogotá was just one of his desk jobs from 1989 to 1995, and ordering the operation did not involve entering the field himself, or did but was a one-off so not enough to break what he considered 6 years of a desk job.</ref><ref name="CATWS"/>

*[[Vers]] of [[Kree]] [[Starforce]] wakes early from a dream where she is on a sandy piece of land, looking at blue blood on her hand and a woman nearby with a blaster. She looks at her fist, glowing with power.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement">In ''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]'', Fury says Carol Danvers' crash was "6 years ago, 1989". This makes the main events of the film 1995. A June calendar is later shown, making the events June 1995. Finally, on the second evening of the events, a full moon is shown over Louisiana. The Louisiana full moon in June 1995 was June 12, 1995, making the main events of the film June 11-13, 1995, with the final scene about 3 days later, so June 16, 1995.</ref><ref name="CM"/>
*Vers visits [[Yon-Rogg]], her mentor and the leader of Starforce. They go to train, having a fight as he reminds her to let go of her past and keep her emotions in check if she wants to be a warrior.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
*Yon-Rogg takes Vers to see the [[Supreme Intelligence]], telling her that it takes the form of whomever you admire the most, but refusing to say who it is he sees. He tells her that the Supreme Intelligence was the one who gave him the responsibility of showing her how to use the powers they supposedly gifted to her.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
[[File:Supreme Intelligence CM.jpg|thumb|250px|Supreme Intelligence giving [[Vers]] her advice]]
*The Supreme Intelligence appears to Vers in the form of the woman from her dream, whom she does not remember from her forgotten past. It tells her that she is a victim of the [[Skrulls]]' expansion and that they saved her from them, but that her loss of memory might be a mercy, freeing her to do what a Kree must.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
*Starforce assembles for a mission. [[Korath]] tells Vers, [[Att-Lass]], [[Korath]], [[Bron-Char]], and [[Minn-Erva]] about the time a Skrull simmed him and how scary it was, with Vers joking that it is because seeing his own unattractive face was too disturbing. Yon-Rogg briefs the team on their mission, search and rescue for their spy, [[Soh-Larr]] from a Skrull invasion on [[Torfa]], led by the Skrull general [[Talos]]. He explains that the [[Accusers]] will bomb a Skrull stronghold and they will slip in, and should not interfere with the Torfa populace.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
*'''[[Ambush on Torfa]]''':
**Starforce arrives on Torfa. They split up and head towards the temple from which Soh-Larr's beacon is emanating.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
**[[File:Minn-Erva (Captain Marvel).png|thumb|250px|Minn-Erva taking aim as a sniper]]Starforce come across Torfa locals and try to prevent a fight. Minn-Erva prepares to shoot just in case, when Att-Lass tells her to put down her blaster. Minn-Erva then sees through her blaster scope, however, that Att-Lass is with the others on the ground, realizing that the man next to her is actually a Skrull simming him. She shoots him, with him reverting to his natural form as he dies.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
**Yon-Rogg leads a fight against the Torfa people when they come to realize they are all disguised Skrulls.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
**Meanwhile, Vers finds Soh-Larr. However, he knows out Vers, revealing himself to be Talos, and takes her back to his ship.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
*The Skrulls inspect Vers' memories, looking for traces of [[Mar-Vell]]. They trawl through memories in her subconscious that she does not otherwise remember and discover that she knew Mar-Vell under the guise of "Dr. Wendy Lawson", on [[Earth|Planet C-53]].<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
[[File:Captain Marvel VFX 16.jpg|thumb|250px|Vers breaks free]]
*'''[[Escape from Skrulls' Ship]]''':
**[[Captain Marvel|Vers]] awakens and uses her powers to heat her hands, breaking free of the constraints on her arms. With metal cylinders still stuck on her arms, she wallops the Skrull scientists and attacks Talos, asking what he has put in her head, but he tells her it was all already there.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
**Vers runs to escape and is cornered by Skrulls. She manages to fight her way out, however, and runs for an escape pod. Vers is ambushed by more Skrulls and tries to break off the metal cylinders, eventually cracking them with her powers, but accidentally causes a hull breach.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
**Running through the corridors, Vers comes back across the control room. She retrieves her boots and destroys the Skrulls' memory machine, then commandeers an escape pod. Talos arrives and blasts it, but she gets away in the pod, albeit without proper control.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
**[[File:Vers 1995.png|thumb|250px|[[Vers]] trying to escape from the Skrull's ship]]The damage causes the escape pod to be destroyed as it falls through the atmosphere of Planet C-53, which the Skrulls had traveled to in hopes of finding out about Mar-Vell's work. Vers is left in free-fall over C-53, better known as Earth.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>

[[File:Captain Marvel Rock the Vote.jpg|thumb|250px|Danvers tries to communicate with Starforce leader [[Yon-Rogg]]]]
*Having used RadioShack equipment to modify a payphone, Vers manages to communicate with Yon-Rogg and [[Starforce]]. She tells them about the Skrulls being after someone called Lawson, a scientist they believe has cracked the code to light-speed tech. The payphone runs out of money and she loses connection. Staforce head to a jump-point 22 hours away to get to C-53 themselves.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
*[[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] arrives, led by Agent [[Keller]], to inspect the events of the night before, called in by the security guard. Agent [[Phil Coulson]] talks to the guard, while Agent [[Nick Fury]] approaches Vers to ask about the crash. Vers says she is from Starforce and after the Skrulls infiltrating his planet, to which he responds incredulously. Before he can try to arrest her, a Skrull nearby, still disguised as a surfer, shoots a blaster in their direction.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
*'''[[Chase of the Skrulls]]''':
**Vers then pursues the Skrull through Los Angeles, while Fury and "Coulson" get in a car to follow. The Skrull boards a train, simming an old lady it sees alighting the vehicle. Vers follows into the train and searches, coming across the [[Watcher Informant]] as she does, while Fury and "Coulson" follow in their car.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
**[[File:Captain Marvel (film) 09.jpg|thumb|250px|Danvers fighting the Skrull]]Having seen the real old lady leave the train, when [[Captain Marvel|Vers]] sees the same lady on the train, she realizes it is the Skrull.

The Skrull then sims another passenger and escapes through the roof.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
**As Fury drives, he receives a call on his walkie-talkie from Phil Coulson, saying he is still at the Blockbuster Video and that everyone has left. Realizing Vers was telling the truth and that he is with a shape-shifter, Fury attacks just as the Skrull "Coulson" goes to attack him, veering the car off course.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
**The train pulls into the station and Vers looks for the Skrull in the crowd, but she is unsuccessful.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
**The Skrull "Coulson" is killed and reverts to its normal form, scaring Fury as he gets out of the car.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
[[File:Carol Danvers (LA 95).png|thumb|250px|Vers accessing the memories]]
*Vers places the memory crystal into her [[Starforce Uniform]] gauntlet and plays some of the memories. They glitch and eventually stop working, but she manages to get a lead from seeing the word "Pegasus" in one, and "Pancho's" in the background of another.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
*Heading to an Internet cafe, Vers tries to look up Pancho's online, but the Internet connection breaks.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
*While looking for Pancho's on a map instead, a motorcyclist is rude to Vers, asking her to smile for his own pleasure. When he heads into a shop, she steals his motorcycle, then taking clothes from a mannequin.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
*Fury and "Keller" attend the examining of the dead Skrull's body. Fury tells him he has a lead on a motorcyclist fitting Vers' description and heads out to find her. Once he has left, "Keller", in fact [[Talos]] in disguise, wishes his deceased friend a safe journey to the beyond.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
*Vers drives to Pancho's and asks about "Pegasus", but the bartender does not know what she means. [[Nick Fury]] steps out, revealing his presence, and they agree to prove to each other that they are not Skrulls.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
[[File:Captain Marvel EW 06.jpg|thumb|250px|Fury being questioned by [[Vers]] about his past]]
*Vers asks Fury questions about his past, since Skrulls can only sim recent memories. He answers without hesitation, proving himself. She then proves herself by firing a photon blast from her hand, and he agrees to take her to "Pegasus".<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
*During the car journey, Vers insists to Fury that the Kree are noble warrior heroes and that the Skrulls are evil, invading planets. On arriving at the [[Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S.]] [[Joint NASA USAF Facility]], he announces his identity at the entrance to be allowed inside. When Vers is surprised by him having three parts to his name, he tells her that everyone simply calls him "Fury".<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
*Fury and [[Captain Marvel|Vers]] ask for information on Dr. Wendy Lawson and are taken to a room to wait.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
*Inside the room, Fury gets out his [[Transmitter Pager|pager]]. He claims he is only communicating with his mother, but is in fact contacting Keller for backup to detain Vers for information. He helps Vers break out of the room, using sticky tape to get fingerprints off an ID badge, activate the fingerprint scanner, and open the door.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
[[File:Captain Marvel VFX 42.jpg|thumb|250px|Fury and Vers head to check old records]]
*The duo arrive at a lower level where records are held, and encounter what appears to be a cat. Fury is instantly enamored with her, checking her name tag and finding out she is called "[[Goose]]". Vers blasts open the door to secure records, leaving Fury bemused that she left him to do the hard work with sticky tape when she could have helped all along.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
*Looking through the records, they find that Dr. [[Wendy Lawson]] was indeed involved in making a light-speed engine, and Vers recognizes her writings as [[Kree]] glyphs. Fury discovers that she died in a test flight 6 years ago, in [[1980s#1989|1989]], but the pilot is redacted. He mentions that there is a testament from the last person to see them alive, [[Maria Rambeau]], and more fragments of Vers' memory are triggered. Fury leaves, saying he will be back soon, and Vers looks through photos, finding one with herself in the background, climbing into a fighter jet.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
*Vers contacts [[Yon-Rogg]] again and asks what he knows about Lawson. He says he is only cleared to tell her some things, but explains that Lawson was an undercover Kree called Mar-Vell developing tech to help win the war.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
*'''[[Ambush at Joint NASA USAF Facility]]''':
**[[File:Nick Fury & Talos Keller.png|250px|thumb|Talos accidentally blows his cover to [[Nick Fury]]]]Agent "Keller" turns up at the [[Joint NASA USAF Facility]], but when he commends Fury's work, he calls him Nicholas, arousing Fury's suspicions.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
**Vers continues that she remembers Lawson from Planet C-53, but Yon-Rogg cuts her off, saying she is letting her emotions cloud her judgement and that she must not let what might be Skrull interference in her brain get in her way.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
**Fury alludes to a fake mission with [[Keller]] in [[Havana]] to see how the agent responds, and when he claims to recall it, Fury's suspicions are confirmed that Keller is in fact a [[Skrulls|Skrull]].<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
**Yon-Rogg tells Vers to leave her beacon on so he can find her, and she ends the call.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
**[[Talos]], disguised as Keller, is surprised to find no one on the floor Fury sent him to, with Fury having gone back to his previous floor to warn Vers. He is concerned, however, when he cannot find her.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
**As she leaves the archives, Vers overhears [[Phil Coulson]] and another agent, who are surprised to have heard they are supposed to take in Fury. She realizes Fury has been betrayed and might need her help.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
**[[File:Captain Marvel VFX 40.jpg|thumb|250px|Talos is stunned by [[Vers]]' photon blast]]Realizing Fury must have worked out who he was, Talos attacks the agent, and admits to being a Skrull. When he beats Fury down, Vers arrives and hits him with a photon blast. She and Fury then blast up to the next floor and run away.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
**On their way up the stairs, the duo are confronted by Coulson. However, putting his trust in Fury, Coulson lowers his gun and reports that the pair are not down where he is.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM">''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]''</ref>
**[[Nick Fury]] and [[Vers]] get to the main hangar, and Vers has him hand over his [[Transmitter Pager|pager]] after lying to her about how he used it. They commandeer a [[Quadjet]] and Vers finds she has sufficient piloting skills to fly it. The duo take off and get away, realizing that [[Goose]] has stowed away on-board.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
*As they fly, Vers shows Fury the photograph of her she found, as well as telling him that her memories go back 6 years, so there is definitely a connection. They decide to find Rambeau to ask her about what happened.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
[[File:Korath, Yon-Rogg & Ronan.png|thumb|250px|Yon-Rogg talks with Ronan]]

*Vers turns up at the [[Rambeau Residence]] in [[Louisiana]] and asks after [[Maria Rambeau]]. She is greeted by Maria and her daughter, [[Monica Rambeau|Monica]], who hugs Vers and calls her "Auntie Carol", delighted to hear that she has been alive all this time.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
*Monica Rambeau goes to get Auntie Carol's things, which she and her mother have kept, and Fury goes to help. Maria is left to talk to Vers and they reconnect, with Maria reminding her of some of the events of the morning of the crash, which she starts to remember more about. She also rediscovers some of the connection with her best friend, as they start to spark off each other again. Maria tells her that she found it very hard not even being able to acknowledge the mission in which her best friend supposedly died, and that it hurts that she cannot remember who she is or even her name.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
[[File:Carol_&_Maria,jpg.jpg|thumb|250px|Vers being reunited with [[Maria Rambeau]]]]
*Monica Rambeau shows Vers photos they have of her across her life, telling her that she did not get along with her family and they had become her surrogate family instead and showing memories from over the years that they have spent as a trio. Maria hands her the only thing found at the crash: half of her dogtag, saying "Carol Dan-", with the other half, taken with her, having said "-vers" and being the origin of her supposed name.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
*The Rambeaus' neighbour, [[Tom (Neighbor)|Tom]], comes to the door, and Vers - now knowing her name to be [[Carol Danvers]] - answers, suspicious that he is [[Talos]] in disguise. Maria Rambeau closes the door, but when they turn around they find that while Tom was not a Skrull, Talos is in fact inside, waiting for them. Talos reveals that his associate, [[Norex]], is simming Maria outside to trick Monica. He says he needs them to listen, explaining that when he imprisoned Danvers he had not yet come to realize what makes her different from the other Kree, but now, having obtained the black box from the 1989 crash using his shape-shifting for clearance, he has new information that she will also be interested to hear.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
[[File:CMStill-TalosCloseup.jpg|thumb|250px|Talos talks with Danvers at the Rambeau's house]]
*The group put Talos' black box disc into the Rambeaus' computer and play the audio from the 1989 test flight. It triggers the rest of Danvers' memories of the day. She recalls how she had flown with Dr. Lawson in the back and they were shot down by an attacking ship, how Lawson had revealed herself as an undercover alien and been shot by the pilot of the attacking ship: Yon-Rogg, and had to destroy the light-speed engine to stop him from getting it, unintentionally absorbing its power.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
*Talos tells Danvers that the [[Kree]] have been oppressing the [[Skrulls]] all this time, ever since they resisted Kree rule and the Kree destroyed their [[Skrullos|home planet]]. He says that [[Mar-Vell]]'s light-speed engine would have got them to a new home and safety, and asks for Danvers' help in finding the core that powered the engine. Confused about her identity and what to believe, Danvers is unsettled until [[Maria Rambeau]] reminds her how much she cared about her, and how great and strong of a person "Carol Danvers" always was. Relieved, Danvers embraces her old best friend.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
[[File:Nick Fury & Talos.png|thumb|250px|Talos discussing the location of the Laboratory]]
*Danvers tells Talos that the reason he could not decipher the location of [[Mar-Vell's Laboratory|Mar-Vell's laboratory]] was that it was not given by coordinates but state vectors, since it is in orbit, not on Earth. They decide to calculate its position based on where they know it was in [[1980s#1989|1989]] and the vectors.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
*Maria Rambeau is reluctant to leave Monica behind, but Monica convinces her that she will be fine staying home with her grandparents, saying that what her mother is doing is important and she really wants her to go. Maria eventually gives in.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
*Maria Rambeau's parents arrive to look after Monica. Danvers goes to speak to Monica, revealing that she remembers her past with the girl and calling her "Lieutenant Trouble", as she always used to. She shows Monica the color-changing controls on her [[Starforce Uniform|Starforce uniform]], intended for camouflage, and has her modify the suit so she can leave behind the Kree colors. They eventually agree on a red, blue, and gold design to match Monica's [[United States Air Force]] T-shirt.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>

[[File:Captain Marvel (film) 101.jpg|thumb|250px|Yon-Rogg arrives at Louisiana]]
*[[Yon-Rogg]] arrives in [[Louisiana]] and finds what appears to be Vers. He engages her in a Skrull test and while she responds correctly initially, she is unable to reply when he asks her whose blood is in her veins. Realizing it is a Skrull, Yon-Rogg shoots "her" and the Skrull, [[Norex]], reverts to his normal form as he dies. Yon-Rogg reveals that the answer was his - his blood is what Danvers was transfused with, and comes to realize that Danvers has discovered the truth of her past. He contacts [[Ronan the Accuser]], telling him to attack C-53.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
*[[Carol Danvers]], Maria Rambeau, [[Nick Fury]], [[Talos]], and [[Goose]] fly upwards in the [[Quadjet]], modified by Norex for space capabilities. They break through the atmosphere into space to the apparent location of Mar-Vell's laboratory, but can see nothing. However, Danvers guesses that the lab is using cloaking technology and deactivates it from her suit, revealing it before them.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
[[File:Tesseract (Captain Marvel).png|thumb|250px|Goose and [[Captain Marvel]] see the Tesseract]]
*The group board the laboratory and find the core of the light-speed engine: the [[Tesseract]], which Lawson had acquired while working for [[Howard Stark]]'s [[Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S.]]. Danvers takes the cube and Talos calls out a Skrull cry. A group of scared Skrulls come out from hiding places, including Talos' wife, [[Soren]], and [[Talos' Daughter|daughter]]. Danvers realizes that [[Mar-Vell]] had been taking care of Skrull refugees, including Talos' family, while waiting to take them to their new home, and they had been left aboard after her death, now understanding Talos' motivation to find the lab. Soren tells Talos that Mar-Vell had instructed them not to send out a signal as the Kree could find them, and he tells her she did the right thing, embracing his wife and daughter after 6 years apart. He tells Danvers that there are thousands of other Skrulls separated from each other, scattered throughout the galaxy.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
*Yon-Rogg enters with the rest of [[Starforce]] and expresses his disgust at her altered uniform. She confronts him for lying to her and starts to activate her powers, but he turns on the [[Photon Inhibitor]] implanted in her neck and knocks her out, taking her friends captive and the ''{{WPS|Happy Days}}'' lunchbox containing the Tesseract.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>

*[[Att-Lass]] scans [[Goose]] and, hearing she is a [[Flerken]], puts a muzzle over her mouth, confusing Fury as to why it would be necessary. [[Minn-Erva]] says to load Goose onto the ''[[Helion]]'' and eject the others into space.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
*The Supreme Intelligence tells Danvers that she is nothing without what the [[Kree]] have done for her, showing her memories of times she has failed in her life and belittling her as only human. Danvers takes this, however, and insists that being human is enough, instead remembering all those times as moments where she has got back up and persevered, a human trait she is proud of. The Supreme Intelligence says she was reborn on [[Hala]] as "Vers", but Danvers replies defiantly that her name is "Carol", resisting the Supreme Intelligence.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
[[File:CapMarvl20.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Carol Danvers]] while being in custody of the Kree Guards before activating her powers]]
*Danvers' powers start to activate in the real world despite her status, and it causes electrical surges on the ''Helion'' that deactivate Fury and Rambeau's handcuffs and start to break the electrical gate to the Skrulls' cell.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
*Knowing that the Kree have been inhibiting her rather than helping her, Danvers manages to break off the [[Photon Inhibitor]] and set herself free, achieving full "Binary" form as she attains the ability to manipulate cosmic energy throughout her body and glows.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>
*Danvers escapes the Supreme Intelligence bindings, takes back the Tesseract lunchbox, and escapes to find Fury and Rambeau. She tries to hand Fury the Tesseract, wanting to hold onto the lunchbox as a decoy while they get it to safety, but before they can agree, [[Goose]] opens her mouth and giant tentacles come out, consuming the Tesseract easily into one of her internal pocket dimensions. Fury is shocked, having not believed Goose was not just a cat, and cautiously picks her up as Danvers leaves.<ref name="CM June 1995 Placement"/><ref name="CM"/>

**In his quest to bring balance to the universe, [[Thanos]] leads the [[Black Order]] and the [[Chitauri]] forces to the [[Zen-Whoberi]] planet. The Zehoberei are sorrounded and [[Ebony Maw]] orders the population be divided evenly into two groups, one that would be spared and another that would be executed.<ref name="AIW 1990s">In ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'', [[Gamora]] says, "I hated this room, this ship, I hated my life."

This implies that his massacre of half her people occurred "almost 20 years" before Gamora left him on [[2014|August 1, 2014]] in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''. This piece of evidence, along with Gamora's date of birth, calculated from [[Zoe Saldana]] and [[Ariana Greenblatt]]'s ages, places the Massacre of the Zehoberei at approximately August 27, 1995.

It releases a burst of quantum energy and kills Elihas and his wife [[Catherine Starr|Catherine]], leaving their daughter, [[Ava Starr|Ava]], an orphan. The burst of energy leaves Ava in a state of molecular disequilibrium, causing her cells to tear apart and come back together constantly, allowing her to phase through objects but causing her chronic pain and likely to die from the affliction.<ref name="AMatW Ava Starr Flashbacks">In ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]'', Bill Foster is shown to be approximately 56 (Laurence Fishburne's age at the time of filming) in Spring 2018, and Ava Starr is shown to be approximately 28 (Hannah John-Kamen's age at the time of filming) in Spring 2018. The flashbacks showing a young Ava show Bill Foster through a mix of Laurence Fishburne's son, Langston, 29 at the time of filming, and deageing Laurence Fishburne to how he looked c. 1986, aged 25. Ava is shown to be approximately 7 (RaeLynn Bratten's age at the time of filming).

It can be assumed, considering the fact that the actors already look older than 16 and 18 in the November 1996 flashback and Mike Colter's age at the times of filming suggesting Luke would have turned 17 around the early 1990s, as well as the way the brothers' story is told, it can be assumed that they stole the car in the first May after the November 1996 flashback, May 1997.</ref><ref name="LC113" />

Assuming this was from before Carl/Luke went to college, but otherwise as late as possible, it can be approximated to the summer after he finished high school, so when he was 18. With Carl/Luke's date of birth approximated to April 1980 (see [[1980s]] references), this would be Summer 1998, so can be placed around the middle of the academic summer, between the end of term in June and beginning of term in September, so approximately July 31, 1998.</ref><ref name="LC207"/>

[https://www.facebook.com/sukiestyles/posts/629290393911655 Amanda Suk was born on July 30, 1986], making her 31 in August 2017, the middle of filming for ''[[Runaways (TV series)|Runaways]]'': [[Runaways (TV series)/Season One|Season 1]], very much suggesting that Minoru must have been at least 16-going-on-17, for a 31-year-old actor to have any plausibility in playing the character. Therefore, it can be approximated that Minoru was born in December 1998, making her almost-17 at her time of death on December 4, 2015.<br>As well as this, in the flashback in ''[[Doomsday]]'' showing the Minorus in 2001, Nico is only around 4 months old, making it May 2001, and Amy is roughly 2½, indeed making her date of birth approximately late 1998.</ref><ref>''[[Metamorphosis|Runaways: 1.06: Metamorphosis]]''</ref>

Lantom tells him that he cannot skip his lessons for his upcoming confirmation, and that he has to stop getting in fights with other children. He says he can see that he is angry about his situation, and he needs to find a way to harness his anger and should try praying. Murdock says he feels neglected by God, but Lantom advises him to look out for God's more subtle actions.<ref name="DD302 Young Murdock 1998">In ''[[Please]]'', flashbacks are shown of young Matt Murdock, played by Skylar Gaertner as in ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'': [[Daredevil (TV series)/Season One|Season 1]]. Gaertner was approximately 13.4 years old during filming for ''Please''. With Murdock's date of birth approximated to early January 1985 (see [[1980s]] references), this would then place the flashbacks around approximately mid-June 1998. However, Murdock says his "confirmation is in the spring", implying it is winter, and this matches the weather shown (with the scene filmed around December). It can be taken to be the same time of year as when the episode was filmed. With the episode filmed around December 4, 2017, it can be assumed it is approximately the closest December 4th to mid-June 1998: December 4, 1998.</ref><ref name="DD302">''[[Please|Daredevil: 3.02: Please]]''</ref>

*At an away tournament in [[Philadelphia]], {{WPS|DeWitt Clinton High School}}'s basketball team leading scorer [[Tasha Bowles]] and another player, [[Nandi Tyler]], make a deal: Bowles will steal an MP3 player, and Tyler will steal from some wallets. However, while Bowles steals the device, Tyler does not hold up her side.<ref name="LC2 Tyler and Bowles">In ''[[The Main Ingredient]]'', it is stated that Misty Knight was a "14-year-old" when Tasha Bowles stole the iPod and they lost the game. However, ''[[I Get Physical]]'' establishes that Knight was 5 on February 11, 1990, meaning that at the very latest, she was born on February 11, 1985, and therefore at the very latest this was February 10, 2000, despite the fact that the iPod was not released until October 2001. It must be taken that she simply stole an MP3 player, mislabeled by Knight in 2017 as having been an "iPod". With Knight's date of birth approximated to April 1984 (see [[1980s]] references), she would be 14 from April 1998-April 1999, making the basketball season when she was 14 early November 1998 to early March 1999. Therefore, the match can be approximated as roughly early January 1999.</ref><ref name="LC210"/>
*Tyler tells their coach, Coach [[Shaw (Coach)|Shaw]], about Bowles stealing the MP3 player, and she is kicked off the team. This, in fact, had been Tyler's plan all along, setting Bowles up to be kicked off so that, even though they would likely lose their game, the Temple and La Salle scouts would notice her and she could shine. The rest of the team respect her reporting Bowles, including 14-year-old reserve player [[Misty Knight]], unaware of the truth.<ref name="LC2 Tyler and Bowles"/><ref name="LC210"/>
*Tyler's plan fails, as she gets injured in the third quarter. Misty Knight comes off the bench to replace her, having earned her spot on the team. The team still loses the game without Bowles playing.<ref name="LC2 Tyler and Bowles"/><ref name="LC210"/>

*[[Tilda Johnson]] eats at the Stokes family table for the last time. She believes she is 10 years old.<ref>In ''[[Wig Out]]'', "Tilda Johnson says, The last time I ate here, I was 10." It is later revealed that she does not know her actual age, with her date of birth being fake. Her fake date of birth is approximated to 8 months after Jackson Dillard's December 1987 death (see [[1980s]] references), with Mariah Dillard lying and claiming that was the day she found out she was pregnant, so Johnson's fake date of birth is approximated to 3 years after her real August 1985 (see [[1980s]] references) date of birth, around August 20, 1988. Therefore the time when she believed she was 10 would be August 20, 1998 to August 19, 1999. The middle of this time, as an approximation for when she last ate at the Stokes family table, is February 18, 1999.</ref><ref name="LC203"/>

[[File:Kingdom-Flashbacks 1999.png|thumb|250px|[[Geoffrey Wilder]] meets with [[Jonah]]]]
*[[Jonah]] meets with [[Geoffrey Wilder]] while he serves a prison sentence. [[Catherine Wilder|Catherine Henderson]], Wilder's partner and lawyer, arrives to join the meeting, and Jonah tells Wilder that he wants to buy a property he owns, an old strip mall, for a surprisingly large $5 million. Wilder is suspicious of his motivations, but Jonah says that he simply wants to make the most of the location - but that he can only make the deal if Wilder is a free man, available to work with him. Henderson has an idea for how she can set him free, and Jonah says that this would mean the deal could indeed proceed.<ref name="R105 1999 Placement">In ''[[Kingdom]]'', it is shown that Wilder meeting Jonah was "18 years ago" from December 11, 2017. This would suggest approximately December 11, 1999, but also in the general sense of "18 years" before 2017, 1999, any time in 1999 (average July 2, 1999). Putting more weight on the exact 18 years, but considering the possibility that it could be any point in 1999, overall, this can be calculated to approximately ([December 11, 1999] × 2 + [July 2, 1999] × 1) ÷ 3 = October 18, 1999.</ref><ref name="R105" />
*Wilder meets with his friend [[Darius Davis]], who is incarcerated with him, and offers him a deal. He explains that if Davis lies and claims that he was the one to shoot Osiris - the man Wilder is convicted for shooting - then with Wilder freed from prison, he will be able to make a deal that will change their lives, and then will make sure he protects and helps Davis' friends and family. Davis is reluctant to increase his sentence, but eventually agrees.<ref name="R105 1999 Placement" /><ref name="R105" />

[[File:SMH Previs 2.jpg|thumb|250px|The scene depicted in Spider-Man: Homecoming]]
*In the film ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' there is a scene where [[Spider-Man]] tries to apprehend [[Adrian Toomes' Crew|Vulture's men]] in the Staten Island Ferry, the director [[Jon Watts]] pointed out at a mistake that occurred creating that action sequence: ''"“The only real flaw is that there are cars on the ferry, and there haven’t been cars allowed since the ’90s. So I’ll declare that in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], they never had these rules.”'' This proves that the reality from the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] sometimes differs from the real world reality.<ref>[http://ew.com/movies/2017/07/08/spider-man-homecoming-ferry-scene/ Spider-Man’s ferry tale: A closer look at one of Homecoming's coolest scenes]</ref>
