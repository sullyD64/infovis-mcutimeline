This is a timeline of events that occurred in 2017.

==2017==
===January===
====1st====
*[[Alphonso Mackenzie]] has a long awaited dinner date with [[Elena Rodriguez]]. He calls her Elena for the last time for the next three months.<ref name="AoS408"/><ref name="AoS411"/><ref name="AoS4 Events Between Seasons"/>
*He and Coulson return to the Zephyr, as is routine, to renew their pursuit of Quake, following a new lead from her incident in Atlanta. They continue tracking her whereabouts, and hoping to bring her in.<ref name="AoS411"/><ref name="AoS4 Events Between Seasons">In ''[[Wake Up]]'', Coulson says, "I spent six months on a plane with [Mackenzie]." It is said in ''[[Vendetta]]'' that "Coulson had just stepped down" in the scene in which we see him heading off to board the Zephyr for the beginning of the six-month span. Due to the April 17, 2017 date in ''[[Wake Up]]'', ''[[The Ghost]]'' ideally picks up in March 2017 (see other references). Working back from this, the events of ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot]]'', and the first boarding of the Zephyr, is in September 2016. This works with ''Slingshot'', as it picks up just before ''[[Broken Promises]]'' on April 13, 2017 (see other references), it then flashes back to the Baltimore incident, referring to it as "Several months ago". With the Baltimore event on September 30, 2016, this is 7 months prior. It is dated as late September - September 30, 2016, to allow time for Mace being selected for, and then go through Project Patriot, but still fit with Mace's statement in ''[[The Patriot]]'', "Few months [after Vienna], Talbot came to me with an offer." This still fits, with the bombing being on June 23rd, and his selection being September 8th, 2½ months later. It is implied that Mackenzie and Coulson began testing the limits of the Zephyr, to go for weeks and weeks on a thorough hunt for Johnson, and that the director wanted to keep [[Coulson's Team]] apart after he took over, as the duo get to only see their friends every few weeks when coming back for restock. They get back after their last trip of 6 weeks (their furthest yet, impressing Fitz), and Fitz and Simmons are excited to see them, with Fitz exclaiming, "Six weeks. That's a record!" Coulson at this point has indeed spent 6 months with Mackenzie living mostly on the plane - September 30, 2016 to March 18, 2017.</ref>

====5th====
*[[Nelson's Meats]] hits a tight time financially. [[Theo Nelson]] gets a call from [[Red Lion National Bank]], who instruct him on how to manipulate their accounts to present a stronger position and regain suppliers. Unbeknownst to him, [[Wilson Fisk]] manipulated him by orchestrating the whole thing to then use the Nelsons' illegal acts as leverage on [[Foggy Nelson]].<ref>In ''[[Revelations]]'', Theo Nelson says that "a few months" after the Nelson's Meats suppliers stopped taking orders on September 24, 2016 (see [[2016]] references), Red Lion National Bank reached out. Taking this to mean approximately 3.5 months, Red Lion reaching out can be approximated to January 5, 2017.</ref>

====15th====
*[[Brigid O'Reilly]] moves from [[Harlem]] to [[New Orleans]]. Her friend [[Misty Knight]] is still taking time off from the [[New York City Police Department]], so is not present for her departure.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9d8dOY7e58&t=1382s ''Cloak & Dagger'': Season 1 is O'Reilly's first case in New Orleans], implying she moved approximately a month before the case on February 15, 2017.</ref><ref name="LC208"/>

====18th====
*[[Stephen Strange]] begins to write an email to [[Christine Palmer]], but decides not to send it.<ref name="DS October 2015-January 2017 Placement">[https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/empire-podcast-doctor-strange-spoiler-special-scott-derrickson/ Scott Derrickson said, "It's months that he's in recovery, I think it's between 3 and 6 months. Yeah, I think it's about 3 to 6 months. Somewhere in there <nowiki>[...]</nowiki> I think - gosh, don't hold me to this because again I haven't thought about this in a long time <nowiki>[...]</nowiki> but I think it's about a year from the beginning of the movie to his return to New York. And so, <nowiki>[...]</nowiki> I think it starts early fall, to late fall, so it's a little over a year, because I think it's like winter-y when he has the fight with Christine, it's like that cold, New York, really dark grey, nearly snowing kind of vibe."]<br>On the day of Strange's car crash, he checks his watch and [[:File:DS Promo Clip - The Multiverse 7.png|it says "TUE", "2016", "FEB", "2"]], making it Tuesday, February 2, 2016. While this does not fit with the fact that ''WHiH'' [https://twitter.com/WHIHOfficial/status/727256906952138753 tweeted on May 2, 2016] and posted a [[WHIH Newsfront Exclusive: President Ellis Discusses the Avengers|video]] on May 3, 2016 (and ''[[WHiH Newsfront (web series)|WHiH Newsfront]]'' is proven to be set in real time, ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkZwlIYLNBQ 1], [https://twitter.com/WHIHOfficial/status/616657863876956160 2], [https://twitter.com/WHIHOfficial/status/617408255283884032 3], [https://twitter.com/WHIHOfficial/status/723617629328416768 4], and other dialogue in videos matching with dates given)) about Strange being a surgeon, Scott Derrickson [https://twitter.com/scottderrickson/status/959550885075468288 tweeted to confirm the February 2nd date] as well as retweeting another post about it.<br>With the beginning of the film in "early fall" and the end of the film in "late fall", "a little over a year" later, and the February 2016 car crash falling between the two, this would mean the film begins around early Fall 2015 and ends around late Fall 2016. However, Derrickson also says that Strange recovers for 3-6 months, and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYxmUMCNxCo Mads Mikkelsen says Strange trains for "9 months" before his clash with Kaecilius], which overall would suggest the film ends 12-15 months after Strange's car crash, thus placing the ending around February-May 2017. This, in turn, using Derrickson's comment about "a little over a year" ("early" one season to  "late" the same season a year later would mean 4⅔ seasons, so about 14 months), would, working backwards, place the opening of the film between December 2015 and February 2016 (the latest it can be, before Strange's car crash).<br>Overall, using weighted math from all the evidence available, the details of which can be seen [[User:Marvelus/Phase Three Timeline#Doctor Strange|here]], the result is that the opening is October 13, 2015, the car crash February 2, 2016, the argument with Christine March 29, 2016, Strange's arrival in Kathmandu May 4, 2016, and the climax January 18-19, 2017.<br>This would put the opening still in the early part of fall (working with Derrickson's comment), the argument with Christine towards the end of the snowy period and a bit after winter, but enough time after Strange's crash and a good time for the heavy rain (a bit later than Derrickson's comment but realistic), his arrival in Kathmandu 3 months after his crash (just fitting inside Derrickson's 3-6 months comment), the climax another 8.5 months later (just fitting for Mikkelsen's "9 months" comment), and the climax a bit after Fall 2016, instead Winter 2016-17 (a bit later than Derrickson's comment) but fitting as "a little over a year" (15 months) after the opening (fitting reasonably with Derrickson's comment), a realistic time of year for the snowfall at the Ancient One's death, and working with the other comments just described. This also works fine considering Derrickson made it clear he did not want to be fully held to his comments.<br>The specific dates of smaller events in between can also be found [[User:Marvelus/Phase Three Timeline#Filling in the Gaps|here]].</ref><ref name="DS"/>
*Strange goes to the Kamar-Taj Library in order to obtain more books. However, when he calls for [[Wong]], he does not show up. Strange goes to the [[Ancient One]]'s private collection and starts to read the [[Book of Cagliostro]].<ref name="DS October 2015-January 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DS"/>
[[File:Benedict-cumberbatch-doctor-strange-movie.jpg |thumb|250px|[[Doctor Strange]] uses the Eye of Agamotto for the first time]]
*Strange finds instructions on how to use the [[Eye of Agamotto]]: a magical item kept only a few meters away, and experiments with its power. Strange begins to manipulate time for the apple he has been eating, turning it back in its time to regrow, and forward until it rots. Strange uses this power to recover the lost pages stolen by [[Kaecilius]] in the book, and comes to realize the Eye's powers of control over the time of objects. He is caught by [[Wong]] and [[Karl Mordo]], who both angrily warn Strange not to disturb the natural law, noting that misuse of items of such incredible power could cause Strange to become trapped in a time loop forever.<ref name="DS October 2015-January 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DS"/>
*Wong and Mordo take Strange to the Sanctum Chamber and reveal the real purpose of the [[Masters of the Mystic Arts]]: for keeping [[Dormammu]] and other mystical evil entities away from [[Earth]]. They also tell him about the three Sanctums across the globe in [[New York City]], [[London]], and [[Hong Kong]], as locations from which the sorcerers can protect the Earth.<ref name="DS October 2015-January 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DS"/>
*'''[[Destruction of the London Sanctum]]''':
**[[Kaecilius]] and his [[Zealots]] infiltrate the London Sanctum and kill all the [[Masters of the Mystic Arts]] defending it, including [[Sol Rama]]. Kaecilius then successfully destroys the London Sanctum by creating a massive explosion.<ref name="DS October 2015-January 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DS">''[[Doctor Strange (film)|Doctor Strange]]''</ref>
**In the chamber, Wong and Mordo become worried as alarm bells sound. The trio opens the door leading to the [[London Sanctum]], only to see [[Kaecilius]]' destruction.<ref name="DS October 2015-January 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DS"/>
**[[File:Sol Rama 3.png|thumb|250px|Strange is ambushed by [[Kaecilius]]]]The explosion rips through into [[Kamar-Taj]] and knocks everybody off their feet, trapping Strange in the [[New York Sanctum]] as he is separated from his allies and unable to return to Kamar-Taj.<ref name="DS October 2015-January 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DS"/>
*Stunned from the explosion, Strange starts looking for help, walking through the New York Sanctum. He soon discovers the [[Rotunda of Gateways]], as well as the [[Cloak of Levitation]].<ref name="DS"/> He encounters Master [[Daniel Drumm]], who hears commotion downstairs, heading down to face the Zealots attacking the Sanctum, instructing Strange to stay put. Strange, however, chooses to follow.<ref name="DS October 2015-January 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DS Deleted Scenes">[[List of Deleted Scenes#Doctor Strange|''Doctor Strange'' Deleted Scenes]]</ref>
*'''[[Battle at the New York Sanctum]]''': 
**Strange witnesses Kaecilius murdering Drumm. He reveals his presence, forcing the Zealots to attack him, and despite the fact that they had trained for years, Strange manages to fight them with little problem, conjuring eldritch whips and shield mandalas of light to protect himself.<ref name="DS October 2015-January 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DS"/>
**During the fight, Strange discovers that, due to [[Dormammu]]'s influence, they are capable to alter the real world outside the [[Mirror Dimension]]. He decides to use the [[Rotunda of Gateways]] to his advantage, trapping one of Kaecilius' disciples in the desert and the other, [[Lucian Aster]], in the jungle, leaving only himself and Kaecilius to continue fighting through the New York Sanctum.<ref name="DS October 2015-January 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DS"/>
**[[File:DStrange-PostKaeciliusFight.jpg|thumb|250px|Strange speaks to the captured [[Kaecilius]]]]Strange attempts to intimidate [[Kaecilius]] with the [[Brazier of Bom'Galiath]], but he does not use how to use it. Kaecilius throws him into the [[Cloak of Levitation]]'s glass case, but the cloak wraps itself around Strange's shoulders and helps him in the fight. The cloak guides Strange to the [[Crimson Bands of Cyttorak]], allowing him to trap Kaecilius and end the fight.<ref name="DS October 2015-January 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DS"/>
**Strange tries to interrogate [[Kaecilius]], but he tells Strange only that time and death are insults, and that the [[Ancient One]] extracts powers from the [[Dark Dimension]] herself, to obtain extended life. Soon, Kaecilius notes that Strange's [[Sling Ring]] is missing, as Aster makes it back into the Sanctum and stabs Strange with a Space Shard, almost killing him. The [[Cloak of Levitation]] protects Strange by attacking Aster and removing the Sling Ring from his hand.<ref name="DS October 2015-January 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DS"/>
[[File:DStrange-BloodyHands-OpeningPortal.jpg|thumb|250px|Strange attempts to escape from [[Lucian Aster]]]]
*Strange uses the [[Sling Ring]] to transport himself to [[Metro-General Hospital]], where he calls out [[Christine Palmer]] so she can tend to his wounds secretly. Surprised to see Strange again, appearing out of nowhere wearing unusual clothes, and after all this time, Palmer soon begins to tend his wounds as they talk about what was he has been doing during all the time he has been gone. Strange apologizes to her for having treated her poorly the last time they saw each other.<ref name="DS October 2015-January 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DS"/>
*'''[[Duel on the Astral Plane]]''':
**While Palmer operates on him, Strange projects his astral form and uses it to guide her surgery, leaving her bewildered. [[Lucian Aster]] uses his astral form to escape from the [[Cloak of Levitation]], and uses the portal Strange left open so as to follow to Metro-General.<ref name="DS October 2015-January 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DS"/>
**Strange discovers Aster in the hospital and a battle ensues between the two of them, disturbing several objects in the physical world as Palmer continues performing the surgery.<ref name="DS October 2015-January 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DS"/>
**[[File:DStrange-PowerUp-FightingLucian.jpg|thumb|250px|Strange overloads and destroys [[Lucian Aster]]]]Palmer eventually shocks Strange twice with a defibrillator, which charges up his astral form enough to kill Aster.<ref name="DS October 2015-January 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DS"/>
*Strange returns to his body as Palmer finishes her work on his wound. Strange explains that he went to [[Kamar-Taj]] in order to heal his wounds, but instead ended up learning magic.<ref name="DS October 2015-January 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DS"/>
*Now sufficiently better, Strange decides to return to the New York Sanctum and continue his fight against the [[Zealots]]. He shows Palmer the portal he made with his Sling Ring, confirming what he was saying to be completely true.<ref name="DS October 2015-January 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DS"/>
*Strange arrives at the New York Sanctum where he meets with the [[Ancient One]] and [[Karl Mordo]], discovering that [[Kaecilius]] escaped from the [[Crimson Bands of Cyttorak]]. Impressed by his actions, the Ancient One names him the new protector of the New York Sanctum. However, Strange confronts her about drawing power from the [[Dark Dimension]], causing her to leave abruptly.<ref name="DS October 2015-January 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DS"/>
*'''[[Battle of the Mirror Dimension]]''':
**Mordo and Strange argue about the [[Ancient One]], but they are interrupted as [[Kaecilius]] and his [[Zealots]] return to destroy the Sanctum.<ref name="DS October 2015-January 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DS"/>
**[[File:Mirror Dimension Battle.png|thumb|250px|The Zealots chase the duo in the Mirror Dimension]]Strange drags all of them into the [[Mirror Dimension]] so Kaecilius is unable to destroy the Sanctum, and steals his [[Sling Ring]] so he cannot escape. Mordo and Strange proceed to run away so they can escape, locking Kaecilius and his Zealots in the Mirror Dimension forever, but Kaecilius and his group start to chase them.<ref name="DS October 2015-January 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DS"/>
**Kaecilius distorts the terrain around them so Strange and Mordo cannot reach their portals to escape.<ref name="DS October 2015-January 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DS"/>
**The Zealots chase and warp nearby buildings and skyscrapers, causing Strange and Mordo to plummet down the twisting [[New York City]] landscape. Kaecilius and the Zealots eventually manage to separate the two before cornering Strange.<ref name="DS October 2015-January 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DS"/>
**[[File:DS Promo Clip - 5 Days 2.png|thumb|250px|The Ancient One fights the [[Zealots]]]]The [[Ancient One]] arrives in time to rescue Strange and Mordo by warping the dimension herself to move them away to safety. In doing so, she unintentionally confirms the fact that she draws power from the [[Dark Dimension]] as the dimension's symbol appears on her forehead. A battle ensues between her and the Zealots, led by Kaecilius, resulting in her old student stabbing her through one of his Zealots, and pushing her out of the [[Mirror Dimension]] and back into the [[Earth|Earth Plane]] with a Sling Ring, where she falls to a harsh impact on the streets of New York. Strange and Mordo follow through the portal to help her.<ref name="DS October 2015-January 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DS"/>
*Strange rushes the Ancient One to [[Metro-General Hospital]] where they are received by [[Christine Palmer]], who proceeds to help her in the surgery room along with other members of the hospital.<ref name="DS October 2015-January 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DS"/>

====19th====
*[[File:Astral Form Snow.png|thumb|255px|Strange talks with the [[Ancient One]] before she passes away]]A few hours after the surgery began, at 2:42AM, the Ancient One leaves her physical form and goes out onto a balcony, prompting [[Doctor Strange]] to astrally project and follow her, realizing what she is doing. The two talk, and she tells him about the Dark Dimension and why she had drawn her power from there, claiming that it was necessary to help protect others. Strange warns that Mordo will not be so understanding of her. The Ancient One also reveals that she has seen the future, and she knows that this is her final moment. She warns Strange of [[Dormammu]]'s powers, and holds Strange's hand as she watches snowfall over a nighttime [[New York City]], before her form vanishes, signifying her death.<ref name="DS October 2015-January 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DS"/>
*In the very early hours of the morning, stunned by the death of his mentor, [[Stephen Strange]] washes his hands. He says goodbye to [[Christine Palmer]], before leaving again to fight the [[Zealots]].<ref name="DS October 2015-January 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DS"/>
*[[Kaecilius]] and his [[Zealots]] arrive at the [[Hong Kong Sanctum]] where [[Wong]], along with other [[Masters of the Mystic Arts]], is preparing to make a stand. A battle ensues, resulting in the defeat of the Masters and the death of Wong. Kaecilius destroys the Sanctum and prepares to summon [[Dormammu]], who begins to fuse [[Earth]] with the [[Dark Dimension]], starting above the remains of the Hong Kong Sanctum.<ref name="DS October 2015-January 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DS"/>
*Meanwhile, Strange reunites with Mordo at the [[New York Sanctum]], and they decide to stop [[Kaecilius]] and his Zealots together.<ref name="DS October 2015-January 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DS"/>
*'''[[Battle at the Hong Kong Sanctum]]''':
**The duo arrive only to find the Sanctum already destroyed, and the Masters who decided to protect it already dead.<ref name="DS October 2015-January 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DS"/>
**[[File:Doctor Strange EW Screencap 01.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Doctor Strange]] reverses time using the [[Eye of Agamotto]]]]Knowing that they have no other option, Strange decides to use the [[Eye of Agamotto]], breaking the Natural Laws of Time, to turn back time for the city and reverse what has happened. He frees both himself and Mordo from the time reversal, and the reversal returns [[Wong]] and many others from the dead, despite Mordo's protests. However, Kaecilius breaks free of the time reversal as well and a battle breaks out in the rebuilding city. Kaecilius stops Strange from completing the spell, freezing time for the city around them and ensuring that the [[Dark Dimension]] will still arrive despite Strange's best efforts. Kaecilius says that Dormammu's arrival could not be stopped anymore, saying that his dimension is "beyond time".<ref name="DS October 2015-January 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DS"/>
*'''[[Skirmish in the Dark Dimension]]''':
**Upon hearing Kaecilius' words, Strange figures out a way to defeat Dormammu, and heads to the Dark Dimension, where time is irrelevant. Strange arrives at the Dark Dimension and before he confronts Dormammu, he uses the [[Eye of Agamotto]] to create an unending loop.<ref name="DS October 2015-January 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DS"/>
**[[File:Dormammu-doctor-strange-2016.png|thumb|250px|Dormammu fights Strange]]He tells [[Dormammu]] he wants to bargain, but the evil entity refuses, killing him many times before Strange reveals that the loop he created has put them in a endless cycle for the whole of eternity; the only trap Dormammu could not escape from, since the [[Dark Dimension]] was a place beyond time, and therefore Dormammu has no power over it.<ref name="DS October 2015-January 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DS"/>
**Eventually, Dormammu begins begging [[Doctor Strange]] to end the time loop, which he does, on the condition that Dormammu banishes himself and the [[Zealots]] from Earth forever.<ref name="DS October 2015-January 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DS"/>
**Dormammu does this, turning the Zealots and [[Kaecilius]] into Mindless Ones and dragging them into the Dark Dimension forever, sealing the portal between the dimensions.<ref name="DS October 2015-January 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DS"/>
*Strange returns to [[Wong]] and [[Karl Mordo]] on [[Earth]]. Mordo leaves the [[Masters of the Mystic Arts]], disillusioned by their dishonest, questionable, and dangerous uses of magic, after having witnessed both Strange and the [[Ancient One]]'s rash actions be pardoned.<ref name="DS October 2015-January 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DS"/>
*[[Doctor Strange]] returns to [[Kamar-Taj]] with [[Wong]]. He replaces the [[Eye of Agamotto]], saying that he is not yet worthy of wielding it; [[Wong]] tells him that this is wise, revealing the Eye's true nature as holding an [[Infinity Stones|Infinity Stone]], a term Strange does not understand.<ref name="DS October 2015-January 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DS"/>
[[File:Sorcerer Supreme.jpg|thumb|250px|Strange accepts his position as the protector of the [[New York Sanctum]]]]
*Strange embraces his position as the new protector of the [[New York Sanctum]]. Strange puts on his broken watch from [[Christine Palmer]], and, wearing the [[Cloak of Levitation]], looks out on New York City.<ref name="DS October 2015-January 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DS"/>

*[[Tandy Bowen]] enters a club and spots at a [[Rick Cotton|rich young man]] in the VIP area.<ref name="C&D1 February 2017 Placement">''[[Cloak & Dagger]]'': [[Cloak & Dagger/Season One|Season 1]] is set up in the lead-up to Mardi Gras in February, and includes the 8-year anniversary of the oil rig explosion, tying them explicitly to being exactly 8 years apart, both in February of their respective years. However, the evidence for which years (if the explosion was 2007 and present 2015, explosion 2008 and present 2016, explosion 2009 and present 2017, explosion 2010 and present 2018) is extremely contradictory.<br>The total evidence for a February 2007 accident and February 2015 present events:
*In ''[[First Light]]'', security footage of Tyrone stealing the car radio says "2007-04-18". This does not match as any February, though is closest to February 2007.
*Jeph Loeb stated about the Marvel Television seasons released between April 27, 2018 and April 26, 2019, [https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/8pbxyk/im_jeph_loeb_head_of_marvel_tv_ama/e0a5ju5/ "For the most part our stories will take place BEFORE Thanos clicked his fingers,"] and later made more clear, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UqrlizXWIM&t=2015s "The short answer is that the stories that you're seeing, unless otherwise noted, all happen before <nowiki>[...]</nowiki> "the Thanos Snap". And we'll continue to be in that place until we find out what happens in ''Avengers 4'',"] Season 1 and the first half of Season 2 released in this period, meaning they are set before ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' in Spring/early Summer 2018. Since Season 2 takes place explicitly 8 months later in October, then it cannot be later than October 2017, making Season 1 February 2015, 2016, or 2017 - not 2018.
*In ''[[Call/Response]]'', a poster is up at the Wild Red Hawks for an event on "Friday, Jan. 30". January 30th was a Friday in 2015, though it could just be a much older poster left up for commemorative reasons.
The total evidence for a February 2008 accident and February 2016 present events:
*In ''First Light'', security footage of Tyrone stealing the car radio says "2007-04-18". This does not match as any February, though it would make most sense in-universe for it to be February 2008, with the camera clock set back several months by accident due to something like a reset.
*In ''[[Suicide Sprints]]'', Adina Johnson's vision shows the "missing" dates of her children as being "6/6/08". The closest February is 2008, and this would make sense, for her to still be very anxious about a second child dying 4 months later, and the 6/6/08 actually being the date of her anxiety rather than the date of Billy's death.
*In ''Call/Response'', ''[[Shadow Selves]]'', and ''[[Rabbit Hold]]'', it is shown in obituaries that Billy Johnson was born on "August 1, 1990" and died aged "17", with another obituary in ''[[Princeton Offense]]'' also saying he was 17. If he were born in August 1990, the February where he was 17 would have been 2008.
*In ''Princeton Offense'', Peter Scarborough's Wikipedia page says, "In 2009, after supervising the Roxxon cleanup effort in New Orleans following an oil rig explosion, Scarborough transitioned to a consulting position." This could potentially work with the accident being February 2008, with cleanup in 2008 and then Scarborough moving on in early 2009.
*Jeph Loeb's statement as mentioned.
*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9d8dOY7e58&t=1382s Emma Lahana says this is O'Reilly's first case in New Orleans]. Nandi Tyler says in ''[[Luke Cage (TV series)|Luke Cage]]'': [[Luke Cage (TV series)/Season Two|Season 2]], Episode 8 - ''[[If It Ain't Rough, It Ain't Right]]'', set in August 2017, that O'Reilly has moved to New Orleans. In ''[[Ghost Stories]]'', O'Reilly mentions events involving superheroes with her friend Misty Knight in New York, meaning it is after ''Luke Cage'': [[Luke Cage (TV series)/Season One|Season 1]] in December 2015. If she moved in February 2016, this fits within this range, though it is implied that O'Reilly left during Knight's time away from the force, which would not work with February 2016 since her time off begins in May 2016.
*In ''First Light'', a taxi is shown with a "11 17" registration sticker, meaning it should be between November 2015 and November 2017.
*In ''[[Funhouse Mirrors]]'', Stan Bartlett's license plate says "18". This means that if he just renewed it in the last several weeks, it could be February 2016, with an expiry date in early 2018.
The total evidence for a February 2009 accident and February 2017 present events:
*In ''First Light'', Nathan Bowen's work ID is valid from "30MAR08" to "29MAR10".
*In ''Suicide Sprints'', Adina Johnson's vision shows Tyrone's date of birth as "8/19/00", although Billy's says "02" which is definitely not his real year of birth, so it can be taken that this is not reliable either. In ''Call/Response'', Season 1, Episode 4, Tyrone say, "My parents look at me like a liar and a thief ever since I was 8. They don't trust me. Not really. You know, ever since that night." If his birthday is indeed August 19, 2000, then the February where he was 8 would be February 2009.
*Peter Scarborough's Wikipedia page, as mentioned above, supports 2009 more than it does 2008.
*In ''Princeton Offense'', the oil rig schematics are shown to have been on "9/10/2008", suggesting the accident was after September 10, 2008.
*Jeph Loeb's statement as mentioned.
*As mentioned, Emma Lahana says this is O'Reilly's first case in New Orleans and O'Reilly is still in New York in December 2015 but in New Orleans by August 2017. If she moved in February 2017, this is the only February that fits perfectly since it implied that O'Reilly left during Knight's time away from the force, which began in May 2016.
*The "11 17" taxi registration sticker as mentioned.
*In ''First Light'', Tyrone has a leaflet for [https://thetvshows.us/displayimage.php?album=2594&pid=3028413#top_display_media "FREE COMIC BOOK DAY 1st Saturday in May - May 6, 2017"], which would work in February 2017.
*As mentioned, there is an (unreliable) August 2000 date of birth given for Tyrone in ''Suicide Sprints''. In the same episode, Tyrone mentions that he has known Father Delgado for 3 years, which would suggests he is in February of junior year, meaning he was born 16.4-17.4 years ago, so since it is an August and date of birth and currently February, he would be 16.5. 16.5 years after August 2000 gives February 2017.
*In ''Call/Response'', a magazine says, "Currently chairs a committee in 2017."
*Stan Bartlett's license plate as mentioned says "18", which means it is between 2016 and 2018.
*In ''[[Colony Collapse]]'', on Mardi Gras, Scarborough references the surname Rand being a name that means you are known to be rich currently, implying Season 1, Episode 10: The Rands are referred to, suggesting Danny Rand is back in the world. Mardi Gras in 2016 was February 6th, before Danny Rand has returned, so it does not fit with 2016, but would make it February 2017 or 2018.
*The basketball state finals occur days before Mardi Gras. The basketball state finals in Louisiana tend to be early March, and 2017 is the year where Mardi Gras is as close as possible to this, on February 28th.
The total evidence for a February 2010 accident and February 2018 present events:
*Nathan Bowen's work ID as mentioned.
*The oil rig schematic revisions as mentioned.
*In ''First Light'', ''Lush Life'' by Leo Islo plays in-universe. This song was put online on March 27, 2017, so the only possible February is 2018.
*In ''First Light'', ''Right Now'' by Vindata plays in-universe. This song was put online on February 22, 2017. This is just 12 days too late to fit with February 2017, so the only possible February is 2018.
*Tyrone has a "FREE COMIC BOOK DAY 1st Saturday in May - May 6, 2017" leaflet as mentioned, which could work with 2018 if you assume he just left it up for several months after.
*In ''Suicide Sprints'', Adina Johnson has the book ''Grief Cottage'', which was released August 2017, so the only possible February is 2018.
*As mentioned, there is an (unreliable) August 2000 date of birth given for Tyrone in ''Suicide Sprints''. In ''Rabbit Hold'', it is shown on a poster and stated that Tyrone is "18". The October where he would be 18 would be October 2018, making Season 1 February 2018.
*In ''Princeton Offense'', O'Reilly looks at narcotics arrest files that she describes as being from "about 8 years ago", and the files on screen are from "02/18/2010", suggesting this is February 2018.
*In ''Princeton Offense'', news stories from "hours ago" are real life news stories from September 2017. This does not work for any February, though if it has to suggest one it would be February 2018, because at least those stories have happened by then.
*Stan Bartlett's license plate as mentioned says "18", which works so long as the plate was registered between February and December 2016.
*In ''Ghost Stories'', Tyrone's phone says "Thursday, October 5". October 5th was a Thursday in 2017, and was the day of filming. This does not work for any February, though if it has to suggest one it would be February 2018, because it is more likely if the phone has the wrong date that it would be a past date, not a future one, if the phone was accidentally reset or something similar.
*Scarborough's reference to the Rands as mentioned.
*In ''[[Alignment Chart]]'', an obituary for Kenneth Fuchs says, "Fuchs, aged 32, passed away on February 11, 2018."
Overall, when weighing up the value of each piece of evidence and the specificity and making compromises, February 2009/2017 comes out as the strongest option.</ref><ref name="C&D101"/>

This could refer to a near-exact 6 months (around April 24, 2017) or a more general "October 2017 - April 2017 = 6 months" (so approximating with mid-April, April 15/16, 2017).

Benowitz says they are going to settle the lawsuit against their firm, which is being filed by Hogarth's former assistant [[Pam]] for having gone to prison for Hogarth and supposedly being harassed by her, exploiting her position as her boss. Hogarth disagrees and says Pam was very consenting and never harassed, but Chao highlights that Pam has a strong case. She talks about how Hogarth's actions stained her and Benowitz's good names and the trouble they are going through trying to restore their reputation.<ref name="JJ201 April 2017 Placements"/><ref name="JJ201"/>

Putting more weight in the specific than general, a weighted calculation gives the shutdown as approximately April 22, 2017.</ref><ref name="IF208"/>

*Meanwhile, at the [[Playground]], [[Leo Fitz]] repairs [[Holden Radcliffe (Life-Model Decoy)|Holden Radcliffe's Life-Model Decoy]] and interrogates him with [[Alphonso Mackenzie]] and [[Jemma Simmons]] in order to determine where the original Radcliffe is - though they discover that the android's programming is too sophisticated for them to break into.

Enraged, Fitz unplugs the android and leaves the room.<ref name="AoS412 May LMD Weeks Placement"/><ref name="AoS412"/>
*Meanwhile, Billy Koenig is brought into a dark room inside a [[Watchdogs Submarine|submarine]], where Radcliffe is also being kept, faking imprisonment so as to gain Billy's trust and extract the whereabouts of the [[Darkhold]].<ref name="AoS412 May LMD Weeks Placement"/><ref name="AoS412"/>

*[[Daisy Johnson]] manages to identify [[Leo Babikov]], one of the Watchdogs who attacked the Koenig brothers, proving that Radcliffe has allied with the organization, and thus with Senator [[Ellen Nadeer]]. Sam Koenig then reveals that he knows about the Darkhold because Billy gave it to him, and he then gave it to another Koenig agent, [[LT Koenig]].<ref name="AoS412 May LMD Weeks Placement"/><ref name="AoS412"/>
*[[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] takes LT Koenig aboard the [[Zephyr One]] where she talks to Coulson and the others, explaining "Operation Hot Potato": passing the Darkhold back and forth between the three Koenig agents before hiding it in the [[Labyrinth]], a secured S.H.I.E.L.D. facility.<ref name="AoS412 May LMD Weeks Placement"/><ref name="AoS412"/>
[[File:HRadcliffe-ScanningBKoenig.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Holden Radcliffe]] reviews [[Billy Koenig]]'s memories]]
*Since Billy is the Koenig who had the Darkhold right before hiding it, Radcliffe is able to locate the book from studying his memories. Despite this, Ivanov does not trust Radcliffe's methods and orders that [[Billy Koenig]] should be interrogated to confirm their intel. However, after a brief confrontation during which [[Aida]] beats several Watchdogs and reveals her android nature, Ivanov agrees to head to the Labyrinth immediately.<ref name="AoS412 May LMD Weeks Placement"/><ref name="AoS412">''[[Hot Potato Soup|Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 4.12: Hot Potato Soup]]''</ref>

*'''[[Kidnapping of Billy Koenig]]''': [[Phil Coulson]], [[Daisy Johnson]], [[Melinda May (Life-Model Decoy)|May's LMD]], and the Koenig siblings arrive at the Labyrinth and retrieve the Darkhold right before the Watchdogs attack. When May's LMD finally takes the [[Darkhold]], her secret programming takes over and she refuses to hand it over to Coulson, threatening to kill him. Coulson figures out that he is dealing with an android, and May's LMD is quickly taken down by Johnson, who was warned by Fitz and Simmons. [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] then fights the [[Watchdogs]] but lose the Darkhold, which is taken by [[Holden Radcliffe]].<ref name="AoS412 May LMD Weeks Placement">In ''[[BOOM]]'', [[Phil Coulson]] says that the [[Melinda May (Life-Model Decoy)|LMD version]] of [[Melinda May]] lived with them for "weeks." The May LMD is revealed in ''[[Hot Potato Soup]]''. The episode prior, ''[[Wake Up]]'', is shown to be "5 days" after May's replacement. However, ''Hot Potato Soup'' appears to be the day following ''Wake Up'', if not only a few days later. To compromise these two pieces of evidence, it is reasoned as 2 calendar weeks, from her replacement on Wednesday, April 12th ("5 days" before ''Wake Up'' which is firmly on April 17, 2017 due to it being the day before Hope Mackenzie's birthday, see other references) to Monday, April 24th. 12 days, but 2 calendar weeks - enough to call it "weeks," but with the smallest possible gap between ''Wake Up'' and ''Hot Potato Soup'' of 7 days. ''BOOM'' picks up at least a few days after ''Hot Potato Soup'', but 3 days after ''BOOM'', ''Self Control'' shows that it is snowing. With this being late April at the very earliest, the gap between ''Hot Potato Soup'' and ''BOOM'' has to be minimised to 3 days, taking it to April 27th. ''BOOM'' to ''[[Identity and Change]]'' then follow subsequently from this date.</ref><ref name="AoS412"/>

However, it turns out that Nadeer is not an Inhuman, unlike Shockley, who is horrified when he himself undergoes [[Terrigenesis]].

[[Foggy Nelson]] arrives and Page explains that Murdock is being evicted, but she wants help convincing the landlord to keep the apartment. Nelson says that they need to face the facts: Murdock is almost certainly dead, and they need to let the apartment go. Page says that while it is irrational, she can just feel that he is likely alive, and Nelson agrees just to pay for this month's rent.<ref name="DD301 2016-2017 Events">''[[Resurrection]]'' spans 17 months, from May 9, 2016 (see [[2016]] references) to October 23, 2017 (see other references). With it being difficult to stretch the events of the episode over these 17 months, it would help for Murdock waking from his coma to be as late as realistically possible to minimize the stretching of the scenes after. When Murdock wakes, it is said that he was comatose for "several weeks". With him falling unconscious on May 10, 2016, realistically, the latest it should be is the end of June, with early July leaning more toward "2 months", so June 30, 2016 can be used.<br>By the time of Benjamin Donovan visiting Wilson Fisk in prison, it is less than a month from October 23, 2017, as Fitz finds out about the troubles with Vanessa Marianna when Donovan visits and then at his next meeting with the FBI wants to make a deal because of it, and the meetings are said to be monthly. So, with it already being a big stretch to have the events span 17 months, the Donovan scene should be as early as possible to minimize the stretching for all scenes up to then, so around September 24, 2017. The scene before, of Murdock moving into the laundry room, is shown to be the same day as Fisk being visited in prison, so September 24, 2017.<br>Therefore, the scene of the orphans visiting Murdock and Page and Nelson discussing Murdock's apartment should be distributed between June 30, 2016 and September 24, 2017, so November 27, 2016 and April 27, 2017 respectively.<br>The scene of Grace taking Lantom to see Murdock training is therefore between September 25, 2017 evening and October 22, 2017 daytime, so around October 9, 2017.</ref><ref name="DD301"/>

This would suggest that the accident was soon before this date. This fits with the fact that when Jones looks at her diary from her old home in ''[[AKA Top Shelf Perverts]]'', it is shown to have been her "1996-1999" diary, with infrequent entries, the last of which was in September 1999.<br>A 2000 date for the car crash was supported by [[Jessica Jones (TV series)/Season Two|Season 2]], when, in Episode 1 - ''[[AKA Start at the Beginning]]'', Phillip Jones' ashes box says "Birth/Death Year: 1990-2000", and when, in Episode 2 - ''[[AKA Freak Accident]]'' and Episode 3 - ''[[AKA Sole Survivor]]'', it is show on death certificates that Brian Jones was born in "1954" and died aged "46", Alisa Jones was born in "1956" and died aged "44", and Phillip Jones was born in "1990" and died aged "10" (which was his age at death given in ''[[AKA WWJD?]]'' as well).<br>Throughout Season 2, the car crash is referred to many times as being "17 years" ago, placing this firmly in 2017. 3 dates appear in the season, contradictory to each other (there is no possible way to make any of them fit together) - a "5/5/2017" date in ''AKA Sole Survivor'', a "Thursday, June 1" date in ''[[AKA The Octopus]]'', and a "Wednesday, July 5" date in ''[[AKA Facetime]]''.<br>The "Wednesday, July 5" does not work because it is explicitly the day after a "Sunday", and neither the "Thursday, June 1" nor "Wednesday, July 5" dates work since Nichelle tells Malcolm in ''AKA Facetime'' that it is "3 more months till [her] master's". A master's cannot be taken later than August, making this no later than May.<br>The "5/5/2017" date, however, lines up with the evidence:
*The scene with Nichelle, a little later in the month, would work as being 3 months until Nichelle's master's in August.
*It is just over 3 days since the Empire State Building was shown lit up green - the building was lit up green on the night of May 1st for mental health awareness, and this is now the night of May 4th-5th (early hours of the 5th).
*It is a Thursday-Friday night, matching with it being a "school night" and the next morning being a Trish Talk day, with Trish Talk being a "weekday" show.
*It works with the weather, starting colder but, by Episode 4 - ''[[AKA God Help the Hobo]]'', becoming hot.
*[http://www.newsweek.com/jessica-jones-season-2-timeline-order-how-long-defenders-835820 Melissa Rosenberg stated that the season picks up 6 months to a year after ''Marvel's The Defenders'': Season 1], and April 2017 is 11 months after the season.
So, the season firmly begins in April 2017, with the majority set in May 2017, and the "5/5/2017" date matching the evidence nicely.<br>This means that the main events of the season, from Trish Walker talking to Ian up to Alisa Jones' death, transpire from April 28, 2017 to May 30, 2017.</ref><ref name="JJ201"/>

[[File:MaceMayCoulsonFitz-Framework.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Aida]] reveals her actions to Radcliffe]]
*Aida reveals that the changes happened due to the recent uploading of the consciousnesses of [[Phil Coulson]], [[Jeffrey Mace]], [[Alphonso Mackenzie]], and [[Leo Fitz]], and thus the Framework being adapted to accommodate them. Radcliffe is concerned at Aida's actions, saying that she should never have changed the reality of the [[Framework]] with him being inside, because it could have caused him severe brain damage. He worries further when she reveals that the four LMDs she sent to infiltrate [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] are ready to kill in order to complete their missions.<ref name="AoS412 May LMD Weeks Placement"/><ref name="AoS415"/>

*Aida shows Radcliffe the new body she is building for the Superior, and tells him how she is starting to know the feelings of human behavior, but cannot understand it with logic. She also explains that her two main orders are to protect the [[Framework]], and to protect Radcliffe's life, but that that creates a paradox in her programming. She sees them as a contradiction, because he might become a major threat to the Framework if one day he regrets its creation. [[Aida]] kills Radcliffe and submits him into the [[Framework]] where his consciousness will be preserved, even if his body has perished, to fix the paradox by keeping him safe in a place where he cannot threaten the Framework.<ref name="AoS412 May LMD Weeks Placement"/><ref name="AoS415"/>

Ducass then gets into Walker's car, but the one remaining paparazzo follows them.<ref name="JJ2 Spring 2017 Placement"/><ref name="JJ203"/>
*'''[[Escape from Jessica Jones]]''':
**[[File:Escape from Jessica Jones.jpg|thumb|250px|Jones is attacked by "Hansen"]]At the bar, "Hansen" defends IGH as heroes, saying that they brought Jones back from the dead, since she had died on the operating table after the car accident. She insists they were always trying to save lives, and that the powers were merely a side effect. Jones says they should have let her die with her family, which angers "Hansen", who snaps that she should be incredibly grateful to them, and that she survived for a reason. Jones says that if she did survive for a reason, it was so she could take her and [[IGH]] down, and "Hansen" panics and tries to leave. Jones uses her powers to push the table and stop her, but the woman then reveals herself to have similar powers to Jones', using strength to push the table back. She runs, but Jones catches her. The woman, however, manages to trip Jones and hurl her across the room, then runs.<ref name="JJ2 Spring 2017 Placement"/><ref name="JJ203"/>
**As "Hansen" leaves the restaurant, [[Trish Walker]] and [[Malcolm Ducasse]] arrive outside, with the paparazzo still following them, taking pictures. Jones comes out, and "Hansen" makes a huge leap across the street and onto the top of a building to get away. Jones gives up on trying to follow her, but instead takes the photographer's camera, on which the man had managed to take several photos of the woman. Inspecting them, Jones realizes she has got a lead to follow.<ref name="JJ2 Spring 2017 Placement"/><ref name="JJ203"/>

[[File:Jessica Jones at angry.png|thumb|250px|[[Jessica Jones]] in her anger management class during "summer" 2017]]
*[[Jessica Jones]] attends a mandatory anger management class after attacking [[Pryce Cheng]]. The other attendees tell their stories in turn while bouncing a rubber ball against the wall. Jones tries to leave but the head of the class refuses to sign her court order, stating that she has to stay for the whole hour. She gets up and throws the ball against the wall while angrily telling her, story: her family being killed in a car accident, being experimented on, how she was abducted and raped, and forced to kill someone. She ends by throwing the ball so hard against the wall that it creates a hole and breaks into pieces. Scared of her, the head signs the court order and Jones leaves.<ref name="JJ2 Spring 2017 Placement"/><ref name="JJ204"/>
*Returning to her office, Jones gets angry at [[Malcolm Ducasse]] for letting [[Trish Walker]] out of her apartment the night before, especially as now the press (who got photos of Walker and Ducasse together) are calling him Walker's supposed new boyfriend. Jones looks at the photos of the fake "Leslie Hansen", trying to find a clue, but finds it is hard to concentrate with [[Oscar Arocho]] and his ex-wife arguing loudly in Apartment 6F. Despite this, Jones notices that Hansen was wearing a wig.<ref name="JJ2 Spring 2017 Placement"/><ref name="JJ204"/>
[[File:JJ204a.png|thumb|250px|[[Trish Walker]] answers Jones' call]]
*Jones calls Walker, who is dealing with the press in the aftermath of being pictured with Ducasse. Jones asks her about wigs, explaining that "Hansen" was wearing one. Stating it to have been a good wig, since she had not noticed it, Walker speculates that it must be human hair, narrowing down their search as there are only three human hair wig shops in [[New York City]]. Jones agrees to meet her at one of them, and hangs up.<ref name="JJ2 Spring 2017 Placement"/><ref name="JJ204"/>
*Oscar Arocho's son [[Vido Arocho|Vido]] enters Jones' office, not wanting to be around his arguing parents. He asks the private investigator about her powers, while Jones yells down the hallway to inform them that Vido is with her. When she is not looking, Vido climbs onto her windowsill and crouches on the outside, asking if she could save him if he fell. Jones yells at him to get off and he is startled, causing him to lose his balance and slip. Jones runs and catches him, pulling him up into the room just as his parents arrive. Vido's mother is angry, seeing it as another reason for her to have custody of him over Oscar, and drags her son away. Oscar angrily reminds Jones she has 25 days left before she is evicted, before running after them.<ref name="JJ2 Spring 2017 Placement"/><ref name="JJ204"/>

*[[Pryce Cheng]] confronts [[Jeri Hogarth]] at her office, asking her why she stopped backing him on his charges against Jones.

Cheng informs her that he has hired a new firm and hopes she sorts out what is wrong with her.<ref name="JJ2 Spring 2017 Placement"/><ref name="JJ204"/>
*Jones and Walker meet at the wig shop, and Walker pays the owner, [[Sally]], $300 to give them information on "Hansen". Sally confirms the woman as one of her customers and explains that the woman comes in alone, pays in cash, and had lost all her hair, positing it to have been due to chemotherapy. Jones speculates that "Hansen" was probably saved by [[IGH]] after being diagnosed with cancer, and also that if they found her through [[Metro-General Hospital]], IGH was probably paying her medical bills. The women set out to get her hospital records.<ref name="JJ2 Spring 2017 Placement"/><ref name="JJ204"/>
[[File:JJ204c.png|thumb|250px|Jones promises Walker that she will not hurt [[Max Tatum]]]]
*Outside, in Walker's car, Walker shows Jones the video [[Malcolm Ducasse]] took of her and [[Max Tatum]], saying they could use it as leverage against him and use his clearance at the hospital to get the records. Jones points out that her threats clearly have not been effective as Walker gave Tatum 2 days and it has already been 3, with no results. Planning on blackmailing him further, the duo head off to his movie set.<ref name="JJ2 Spring 2017 Placement"/><ref name="JJ204"/>

*Jones is working in her office when she gets a call from [[Jeri Hogarth]]. Hogarth asks about her progress in digging up dirt on her partners, Chao and Benowitz, but Jones says she has more important things to deal with. She lets her know, however, that she has at least looked into their financial records, but Hogarth tells her to dig deeper as her partners are smarter than to leave evidence in their finances.<ref name="JJ2 Spring 2017 Placement"/><ref name="JJ204">''[[AKA God Help the Hobo|Jessica Jones: 2.04: AKA God Help the Hobo]]''</ref>

[[File:JJ204e.png|thumb|250px|Jones thinks of making a move on Arocho]]
*Arocho and Jones share the whiskey on her couch and discuss her powers. He explains that he does not hate people like her, but admits he just hated her in particular. They start to bond, and eventually Jones starts to kiss him, which he reciprocates. She attempts to initiate sex, but Arocho backs away, saying that she is moving too fast.

They look her up and find that she is homeless. By looking into her they find misdemeanor citations and are able to narrow down which streets she might be living on.

The only episodes with an undefined time gap between them are ''[[Identity and Change]]'' and ''[[No Regrets]]''. The date when Johnson and Simmons enter the Framework is reasoned as April 30th (see other references), and in ''[[Farewell, Cruel World!]]'' it is shown that the beginning of the episode is now 10 days later, putting this on May 10th. This fits, as on May 10th Coulson says that "up until a week ago" he would have thought he was mad to believe in the real world, and May says that "[her] squad's been hunting [Simmons for] the past week." These are both references to events on May 1st being roughly a week ago, and the "10 days" timespan would put those events 9 days prior, which works well enough as an approximate week, and shows that time in the Framework does indeed pass normally. ''Identity and Change'' ends on May 1st, and working back from the May 10th date, ''No Regrets'' would begin on May 9th, putting an 8-day gap between the episodes.

This allows the scene to be June 10, 2017, the day of the Scotland vs. England World Cup qualifier, which he would be interested in. 1 scene then transpires, before the scene where Fitz does push-ups and is estimated to have 45 monkeys on his wall (see other references), making it June 26th. The scene in between, where he eats and looks at Simmons' file, would place halfway between June 10th and 26th, on June 18th.</ref><ref name="AoS505"/>

*Fitz receives the July 2017 edition of ''Ballblaster Hooligan'', shipped over to the [[United States of America]] on his request, in which his letter has been published. He continues to write in to each month's issue, hoping to get the attention of [[Lance Hunter]].<ref name="AoS5 Ballblaster Hooligan">In ''[[Rewind (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Rewind]]'', the first time Fitz asks for his letter to be sent is reasoned as June 3, 2017 (see other references). By the time Lance Hunter arrives on November 25, 2017 (see other references), Fitz says, "They printed my letters in the last six issues of ''Ballbaster Hooligan''," meaning his letters were featured in the issues released in June through November inclusively. Considering the minimum total time needed for Fitz's letter to be analyzed, sent to the U.K., received, edited into the publication of that month's magazine, and then the magazine to be published, with him giving it over on June 3rd, the issue released in June cannot have been released any earlier than June 13th. Considering he has already received the issue released in November by November 25th, the earliest it could have been released to have made it to the U.S.A. by the 24th is November 21st. Considering a magazine for the following month is usually released in the final third of the month before, it can be taken that the fanzine would not have released much earlier than November 21st - perhaps November 20th, to be certain that it made it to Fitz by the 24th on government-priority shipping. This would mean that the fanzine is likely released on the penultimate Monday of each month, and Fitz receives each issue about 4 days later.
<br>In June 2017, this was Monday 19th, so he receives it on the 23rd. In July 2017, Monday 24th, so he receives it on the 28th. In August 2017, Monday 21st, so he receives it on the 25th. In September 2017, Monday 18th, so he receives it on the 22nd. In October 2017, Monday 23rd, so he receives it on the 27th. In November 2017, Monday 20th, so he receives it on the 24th.</ref><ref name="AoS505"/>

[[File:Exercising.png|thumb|250px|Fitz does exercise in his cell]]
*[[Leo Fitz]] trains again, doing push-ups in his cell.<ref name="AoS5 Fitz June 26th-28th">In ''[[Rewind (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Rewind]]'', after the scene where Fitz has 28 monkey faces on his wall (reasoned as June 10th), a scene transpires where Fitz eats and looks at Simmons' file. The next scene then shows him doing push-ups. This is followed by a scene where he scrunches up a piece of work, followed by another push-up scene. He then gets angry about a free kick, and then there is a final push-up scene, before the scene with his 49th monkey face, on June 30th. Last time the monkeys were shown, they were in rows of 4 (incomplete row), 7 | (line on the wall) 7, 7, 3 (incomplete row). In all 3 push-up scenes, it now appears that the 4th row above the line on the wall is 6 (incomplete row). This would suggest that it is 6, 7, 7, 7 | 7, 7, 3-7. It is unknown whether Fitz has added to that bottom row we previously saw incomplete or just left it as an incomplete row of 3. The scene after, with the 49th monkey face, shows that the bottom row has indeed been filled out, so he must have filled it at some point over this time. By distribution, we can approximate that ((1 - 0.5) ÷ 3) × 4 = roughly 1 of the missing 4 has been filled out in the 1st scene, ((2 - 0.5) ÷ 3) × 4 = 2 have been filled out in the 2nd, and ((3 - 0.5) ÷ 3) × 4 = roughly 3 in the 3rd scene. This would mean there is approximately a total of 45, 46, and 47 monkeys respectively in the 3 push-up scenes, thus making them approximately June 26th, 27th, and 28th.
<br>There are very few soccer games on in late June, so it is hard to believe that there were games on consecutive days. Therefore, the game playing in the scene before the push-ups on the 27th and the game playing in the scene after the push-ups on the 27th has to be assumed to be the same game, with Fitz muting or turning it off in the middle for push-ups. Therefore, these scenes are either side of the push-ups on the 27th. There isn't an obvious match that it could be which he is watching, but it can be assumed that the soccer schedule between seasons in the ''MCU'' is not identical to the real world.</ref><ref name="AoS505"/>

Distributing between June 30th and November 25th would give the 6th scene as being roughly November 4th. Fitz receives ''Ballblaster Hooligan'' in October on the 27th and in November on the 24th (see other references). October 27th is the closer of the two to November 4th, so this is the date used - the fifth issue he has received, not the sixth - which matches with the fact that he appears to have approximately 4 other issues on his desk when he throws the new one.
<br>If the other 5 scenes before were then distributed evenly between June 30th and October 27th, it would give August 9th for the 2nd scene, which includes a soccer game. The closest game which Manchester United, Fitz's team, played, was on August 8th against Real Madrid, so this date can be used.
<br>Finally, the 1st scene is placed halfway between June 30th and August 8th, on July 20th, and the 3rd, 4th, and 5th scenes are then distributed between August 8th and October 27th, giving August 28th, September 17th, and October 7th.</ref><ref name="AoS505"/>

She asks for [[Tom Ridenhour]] to enter, believing him a fairer interrogator, and Knight becomes angry, believing Dillard to know about Ridenhour's death since she thinks she is behind it. Dillard, however, is shocked to find out, though Knight is unsure whether she is acting or being genuine. She reveals Comanche's position as a snitch and asks if [[Shades]] might even be snitching as well, but [[Benjamin Donovan]] arrives with Shades to spring her.

He argues that he dealt with it immediately and that it is her fault he got abandoned, but Dillard explains that [[Benjamin Donovan]] left because they cannot pay him. Shades is angered, saying that he warned her not to get involved in the gun deal and just sell her Basquiat painting, but now they are in ruins because of her stubbornness. He suggests that they strike now while [[Bushmaster]] is complacent, and they agree to help each other and work together again.<ref name="LC2 Summer 2017 Placement"/><ref name="LC208"/>

*Talking in private, Knight tells Cage she cannot accept it after her responsibility with [[Tom Ridenhour]] and [[Candace Miller]]'s deaths. She asks him to testify instead, but he says that a black vigilante ex-con will not play in court, and she would be able to twist things to create reasonable doubt.

*At the precinct, [[Misty Knight]] tells Ridley about the deal they want to strike with Dillard and the plan to get her on something else, reluctantly admitting that it is the smart play. Ridley agrees to call DA [[Blake Tower]].<ref name="LC2 Summer 2017 Placement"/><ref name="LC209"/>
*In the research facility, Cage tries to get cocoa from a machine.

*Mariah Dillard sneaks around and overhears Lucas and Cage talking. Lucas tells his son he understands the burden he feels due to having his powers and feeling he is responsible for everyone. Cage says he has been struggling since [[Claire Temple]] left. His father talks about Johnson having helped heal his hand and Cage says there might be science to it. Lucas replies that science, magic, and faith all come from within, but what comes out when the pressure gets too much is what defines a man and a hero.<ref name="LC2 Summer 2017 Placement"/><ref name="LC209"/>
*Riley tells Knight that DA Tower came through with the paperwork. Knight explains that before Ridenhour's death, she was angry with him for wanting to offer a reduced sentence to Dillard, yet now she is agreeing to giving immunity.

However, unbeknown to them, [[Nandi Tyler]] stands outside, listening in.<ref name="LC2 Summer 2017 Placement"/><ref name="LC209"/>
*[[Luke Cage]] approaches [[Tilda Johnson]] and asks about her healing techniques. She explains that she followed in her father, [[Jackson Dillard]]'s footsteps and got into medicine. She says that the ingredients Bushmaster bought from her were arcane and reminded her of ancient rituals she had heard about, involving using [[Nightshade]] to gain strength. Johnson sadly admits, however, that she does not know how to counteract it. Cage requests that she recount everything she knows, and Johnson agrees to, on the condition that he tell her everything he knows about her mother.<ref name="LC2 Summer 2017 Placement"/><ref name="LC209"/>
*In [[Harlem's Paradise]], [[Anansi]] warns John McIver again that Nightshade is not supposed to be used like this and his body will waste away, but he insists he needs some more just to finish his crusade. [[Sheldon]] approaches him and says they still do not have a location on Dillard and Johnson. He says that his other task, growing Nightshade for McIver, is proving difficult, but McIver states sharply that he needs it. Nandi Tyler then enters and tells them she knows where Dillard is, if the offer is still open. Bushmaster happily says it is.<ref name="LC2 Summer 2017 Placement"/><ref name="LC209"/>

*Tilda Johnson approaches her mother, asking for the truth from her. Her mother tells her that the "Dillard" name was a fantasy of escaping the Stokes family, but that the Stokes family was real. She admits that Johnson's father is in fact not Jackson Dillard, that Jackson was in fact gay and she married him because, while they cared for each other, it also helped the other, "proving" to his family that he was not gay and allowing her daughter, who had already been born, to have a good role model father. Johnson confronts Mariah for killing [[Cornell Stokes]], having been told by Cage, and she says she did it because he loved Uncle Pete more than her. Mariah explains that Pete had been kind to her, until he started coming into her room at night and raping her, eventually getting her pregnant - but [[Mama Mabel]] had insisted on not having an abortion. She finishes by confessing that she has never loved Johnson, since every time she looks at her, she sees Pete.

**Bushmaster fights his way up the stairs and [[Luke Cage]] follows him, engaging him in another duel as he tries to stop the [[Jamaica]]n.

Cage admits to Griffith that he has been getting involved to sort things between the different gangs, and Griffith is unimpressed, saying he has become a crime boss. Cage explains that he is the only person in a position to take over who cannot be corrupted, saying he can "make Harlem great again", which Griffith points out sounds too much like {{WPS|Donald Trump}}. He says that if Cage is going to enter this business, he can no longer live at the barber shop, as it is the vital neutral place, "Switzerland", in the neighborhood. Cage accepts this as fair.

*'''[[Ambush on Golden Tigers]]''':
**An armored [[Yangsi Gonshi]] van is moving funds through [[Chinatown]] when they are attacked by members of the rival gang, the [[Golden Tigers]].<ref name="IF2/DD3 Late 2017 Placement">Evidence in ''[[Iron Fist (TV series)|Iron Fist]]'': [[Iron Fist (TV series)/Season Two|Season 2]] places its events in 2018, while evidence in ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'': [[Daredevil (TV series)/Season Three|Season 3]] places its events in 2017.<br>''Iron Fist'': Season 2 takes place after the events of ''[[Luke Cage (TV series)|Luke Cage]]'': [[Luke Cage (TV series)/Season Two|Season 2]], as is evidenced by Rand being in New York City in ''[[The Main Ingredient]]'' but leaving the country after ''[[A Duel of Iron]]'', Hai-Qing Yang appearing late in ''Luke Cage'': Season 2 and being killed early in ''Iron Fist'': Season 2, and Misty Knight having her bionic arm given during ''Luke Cage'': Season 2, as well as referring to her offer of a promotion from that season. ''Luke Cage'': Season 2 takes place firmly in August-September 2017 (see other references), making this no earlier than September 2017. In ''[[War Without End]]'', the "spring fair" is being planned in Chinatown - the fair for Chinese New Year, thus meaning it is coming up, making it the run-up to February 16, 2018. This is supported by Colleen Wing, in ''[[The Fury of Iron Fist]]'', offering to give Lana Tsai "kids' winter stuff", implying it is winter, as well as there being cold weather throughout the season. It is also supported by a laptop in ''[[The City's Not for Burning]]'' with a [https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/File:20180912_160414_(2).jpg January 2018 date]. The laptop also shows that it is 18:58 and dark outside, putting it roughly between October 5, 2017 and March 10, 2018 regardless of the January date. And, in ''[[Target: Iron Fist]]'', Misty Knight says, "This is probably not next year's Christmas card," implying that Christmas has been fairly recently, if next Christmas is still being considered "next year's" (even though it would be "this year"), being in the wake of the last Christmas.<br>The main events of ''Daredevil'': Season 3 are said to be "months" since the events of ''[[The Defenders]]'': [[The Defenders/Season One|Season 1]], firmly in Spring 2016 (see [[2016]] references). The official synopsis says, "Missing for months, Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) reemerges a broken man." In ''[[No Good Deed]]'', Murdock says, "I've had a rough couple of months, Foggy. Questioning a lot of... the point of it all." This would imply merely 2 months since he woke, "weeks" after the main events of ''[[The Defenders (episode)|The Defenders]]'', but this is impossible. It can either be taken that Murdock is using "couple" the informal way to mean "few", or just that only in the last couple of months of his hiding has he started questioning things, though this would not have been long after he recovered. So, either way, this still implies not long since ''The Defenders''. Then, in ''[[The Perfect Game]]'', Karen Page is asked, "When's the last time you heard from Matt Murdock?", and replies, "Um... months," though it can be taken that she is trying to downplay the length of time, without actually lying. It is also generally strongly implied that not much time passes following ''The Defenders'' before the main events of the season. In ''[[Reunion (Daredevil)|Reunion]]'', it is said that Fisk was wrongly convicted "2 years" ago, and in ''[[One Last Shot]]'' it is said that Vanessa Marianna was protected for "2 years". With Fitz's arrest and Marianna going into hiding both being February 2015 (see [[2015]] references), this would suggest it is now early 2017. It is also clearly around winter-time, so it would seem on this evidence alone that it is early 2017, about 8 months after ''The Defenders'': Season 1.<br>However, these are not mutually compatible, as the main events of ''Iron Fist'': Season 2 take place before the main events of ''Daredevil'': Season 3, with references in ''[[This Deadly Secret]]'' and ''[[Citadel on the Edge of Vengeance]]'' to Danny Rand carrying out Matt Murdock's mission (given to him in ''The Defenders'' when Murdock thought he was going to die and wanted Rand to fight in his place), implying Murdock is still thought deceased. The official synopsis for ''Iron Fist'': Season 2 says, [https://www.comicbookmovie.com/tv/marvel/iron_fist/iron-fist-season-2-synopsis-reveals-that-danny-rand-is-stepping-up-to-take-daredevils-place-a162297 "This season, Danny has promised that with Matt Murdock gone, he will step up and protect his city,"] confirming Murdock is still thought dead. All of ''Iron Fist'': Season 2, except for its epilogue, should therefore take place before the reappearance of "Daredevil" during the attack on the New York Bulletin Building in ''[[The Devil You Know]]'', followed shortly by Murdock's public reappearance. Some compromise has to be made wherein ''Daredevil'': Season 3 is later than early 2017, and ''Iron Fist'': Season 2 is earlier than early 2018.<br>''Iron Fist'': Season 2 can be dragged earlier, but at the absolute earliest it is late 2017, with the spring fair committee taken to be planning far ahead of time - a few months. This is a stretch, but again, necessary to make it work. And there are a few things that work better with ''Iron Fist'': Season 2 being late 2017: in ''The Fury of Iron Fist'', Rand says he "missed the last 15 years of culture", having been missing for almost 15 years and now catching up, and while not particularly including the time since he returned, it nonetheless implies it is still close to 15 years since he went missing, and 2017 is 16 years rather than 2018 being 17; in ''The Fury of Iron Fist'' and ''This Deadly Secret'', it is said that it is "months" since Joy and Ward Meachum last spoke, which is implied to be referring if not to [[Iron Fist (TV series)/Season One|Season 1]] then to a time shortly after then, so the shorter the span between Season 1 and 2 the better; Misty Knight is still considering the captain offer, has taken leave to ponder it, and is implied to have not seen Luke Cage since ''[[They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.)]]'', which works much better as a month or so after the end of ''Luke Cage'': Season 2 in September 2017 than a few months later; in ''[[Morning of the Mindstorm]]'' it is said that Rand has been "all over Chinatown for months", which is implied to be referring if not to ''The Defenders'': Season 1 then to a time shortly after then, so the shorter the span between then and this season the better; the epilogue of ''A Duel of Iron'' "months later" fits more comfortably before ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' in May 2018 if ''A Duel of Iron'' is late 2017 than early 2018, and it should be before ''Avengers: Infinity War'' ([https://twitter.com/MRavenMetzner/status/1040696708131254272 1], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UqrlizXWIM&t=2015s 2]).<br>''Daredevil'': Season 3 can be pushed to late 2017, at the latest. This causes problems in relation to ''The Defenders'': Season 1, as it makes it roughly 17 months since then, when it is implied to be only a few months. It somewhat works as "months", being only over a year, not yet a year-and-a-half or 2 years, but it is a big stretch. You certainly cannot push it further, as this is the latest it can be while still being considered "2 years" since early 2015, as well as the absolute most you can stretch the gap since ''The Defenders'': Season 1. But some evidence does in fact support late 2017: this works better with the line in ''The Perfect Game'' from Benjamin Donovan, "an early and very white Christmas"; the season has to be after ''Luke Cage'': Season 2 (finishing September 2017) as, not only is it after ''Iron Fist'': Season 2 which is after ''Luke Cage''; Season 2, but Karen Page is referenced in ''[[The Creator]]'' as still working as a reporter, when she loses that job and begins working for Nelson, Murdock and Page in ''Daredevil'': Season 3; most importantly, the DA election occurred in New York City in the real world in late 2017.<br>With ''Daredevil'': Season 3 pushed forward to its absolute limit and ''Iron Fist'': Season 2 pulled back to its absolute limit, they can just about be pulled to meet at late 2017.<br>There is some evidence for it being very late 2017: heavy snow is shown during ''Daredevil'': Season 3, which works significantly better are November-December than October-November, and the later in 2017, the better for ''Iron Fist'': Season 2 as it is closer to early 2018. However, the majority of the evidence, with a late 2017 placement, would point to October-November 2017: in ''[[Aftermath]]'', is it shown to be 57°F at 18:30 in New York City, which would suggest ideally approximately late October (or mid-to-late April); ''Iron Fist'': Season 2 is seemingly not long after Knight's job offer in ''Luke Cage'': Season 2, with Knight still considering the captain job offer; it is slightly closer to ''The Defenders'': Season 1 (17 months rather than 18/19 - keeping it under a year-and-a-half), so just slightly more plausible for the mentions of "months"; it is also slightly closer to ''Iron Fist'': Season 1, again fitting slightly better with the implications of "months"; it is slightly more plausible as "2 years" since early 2015; it makes it under 16 years since Danny Rand's plane crash when he says he missed "the last 15 years of culture"; most importantly, it fits with the real New York City DA election - it would be odd to align with late 2017 but not quite line up with a big timeline indicator (especially since ''They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.)'' establishes at least some election dates as the same in the ''MCU''), and the election's inclusion can be taken as an indication that it was not meant to be right at the end of the year, despite the snow. So, the two seasons should be in the lead-up to the November 7, 2017 election, as late as possible.<br>The final scenes of ''Daredevil'': Season 3, still before the election, are a Friday (working forward from Poindexter saying in ''No Good Deed'' that it is Tuesday). As late as possible makes it Friday, November 3, 2017. Working back, this puts the attack on the ''New York Bulletin'' building on October 27, 2017.<br>The seasons should overlap as much as possible, to allow ''Iron Fist'': Season 2 to be as late (close to its ideal early 2018) as possible. So, Rand leaving in the plane should be as late as possible while still before the attack on the ''New York Bulletin''. The day of Rand leaving is a Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday, based on dialogue in the season. Taking it to be Friday (the exact same day as the attack on the ''New York Bulletin''), however, also allows the ambush on Fisk's convoy to fall comfortably in the gap between ''Morning of the Mindstorm'' and ''Citadel on the Edge of Vengeance'' in ''Iron Fist'': Season 2, thus meaning that this major event, worthy of citywide news, not being addressed during ''Iron Fist'': Season 2 is not a problem. So, the end of the main events of ''Iron Fist'': Season 2 can be taken to be Friday, October 27, 2017.<br>Working back from there, ''Iron Fist'': Season 2 spans 18 days at an absolute minimum, meaning the latest it can start is Monday, October 9, 2017. However, in ''The Fury of Iron Fist'', Rand jokes that their date nights should become a regular occurrence, "every Tuesday", implying it is currently Tuesday. The latest Tuesday it can be, therefore, is Tuesday, October 3, 2017, with the season spanning 24 days (other than the epilogue). This is a more suitable length, considering the battle at Golden Tigers' Hideout is referred to in ''Morning of the Mindstorm'' as "a few weeks ago" (this pushes it to 2 weeks prior) as well as Rand's recovery from injury - said to be incredibly fast, but still spanning some time - now taking 15 days, while taking into consideration that it is not possible to stretch the season a further week, to start on September 26, 2017, since the passage of time in the season does not fit with much more than the approximate 24 days.<br>Finally, when aligned side-by-side, this gives:
*October 3-20, 2017: ''The Fury of Iron Fist''-''Morning of the Mindstorm''.
*October 22-23, 2017: ''Resurrection'' ending-''No Good Deed'' opening.
*October 24, 2017: ''Citadel on the Edge of Vengeance'' opening/''No Good Deed''.

*As the couple walk home, they are stopped on the street by Davos, who says that if Rand had come home to [[K'un-Lun]], maybe they would have stopped it from falling, also chastising him for allying with someone from the Hand.

*[[Davos]] returns to see [[Joy Meachum]] and tells her about the encounter. He says that Rand refused to give back what he is owed, and that hearing Rand's pompous tone one more time has only emboldened him in his intentions.

*Rand walks Mary a short distance before preparing to leave her. She suddenly becomes dazed and touches his chest, and Rand tells her that he wants to make sure he has not given the wrong impression that he is romantically interested, since he has a girlfriend.

*Joy Meachum manages to stay with Mika Prada until she is drunk, then tells Davos that Prada is married to a congressman, and that if he has sex with her, they can secretly film it and use it as blackmail, since she will be desperate to avoid a scandal. Davos finds the idea distasteful, but Meachum convinces him, reminding him that his purpose should be more important than his code of honor. She walks away, knowing Prada will then make a move on him. While he initially rejects her advances aggressively, she takes it as a masochistic preference, and eventually he reluctantly accepts what he has to do and lets her seduce him. A hidden tablet records the encounter.<ref name="IF2/DD3 Late 2017 Placement"/><ref name="IF202"/>

Wing worries that he has been too obsessed with keeping [[Matt Murdock]]'s torch burning since his apparent death, going out and fighting so much as the Iron Fist so much due to feeling purposeless without [[K'un-Lun]]. He assures her that he just wants to do the right thing and is okay.

*Ward Meachum goes to [[Chikara Dojo]], where he tells Rand about Joy finding out about his NA attendance. He mentions meeting Joy's new partner, misremembering his name as "Dayvos", but Rand realizes he is talking about [[Davos]], concerned about what he might be working with Joy on. He says he wishes the four of them could just talk, and Ward suggests they organize dinner for that night, hoping that he might talk to Joy about [[Harold Meachum|Harold]], having not spoken to her about it since everything that happened with him. He further suggests that they make his attendance appear like an accident. Rand is reluctant to do so, but Ward points out that Joy will not come otherwise, and he agrees.<ref name="IF2/DD3 Late 2017 Placement"/><ref name="IF203"/>
*Rand calls Wing to let her know, as she checks [[Frank Choi]]'s restaurant again, finding it still closed. She goes around the back and tells Rand she agrees that dinner could be a good thing.

*Having left the shop with the book, Wing tells BB that she cannot read the book. She says that [[Henry Yip]] told her Choi owed the Golden Tigers, but BB says that he and "[[Ryhno's Gang|Squad]]" know he always paid up, so he is likely in police custody, which will get him killed for snitching.<ref name="IF2/DD3 Late 2017 Placement"/><ref name="IF203"/>
*Danny Rand gets home and goes to his computer, when a package is slid under his door. He goes back out to see who delivered it and sees Mary leaving the building, chasing her onto the street and catching up with her. She is nervous, saying she had hoped he would be out. She whispers in his ear that someone called "Walker" is watching him and tells him to open the package. Inside Rand finds several pictures of himself, but when he looks back up, Mary has gone.<ref name="IF2/DD3 Late 2017 Placement"/><ref name="IF203"/>
*Back at the dojo, Rand shows Wing the photographs, and they wonder whether Mary was telling the truth or if she took them herself, as some sort of private investigator.

Rand and Wing ask them how they met, and the partners state that they encountered each other in [[Paris]], when Davos was on the way back from [[Tibet]] and heard a maître d' calling out to a "Madame Meachum". Rand invites Davos to come outside to the grill with him to talk.<ref name="IF2/DD3 Late 2017 Placement"/><ref name="IF203">''[[This Deadly Secret|Iron Fist: 2.03: This Deadly Secret]]''</ref>

*Inside, [[Joy Meachum]] asks [[Colleen Wing]] why [[Danny Rand]] invited them over, and Wing replies that they simply wanted to catch up with both of them.

*Over dinner, Wing and Rand ask [[Davos]] what he is doing these days, but he is cryptic in his response. They then ask Joy Meachum what she is planning with her divestment money, but she jokes about not being able to tell the competition of [[Rand Enterprises]], using that as an excuse to not talk. Davos is menacing towards Wing, showing himself to still be angry at her [[Hand]] allegiance, and Wing tries to break the tension, saying they should all admit they are hiding their true intentions, and they need to get everything off their collective chests, asking them to air their grievances, since both people matter greatly to Rand. Davos refuses and walks off to the bathroom, leaving Joy Meachum to talk. She explains that she does not have a problem with Rand himself, just everything that has happened since he returned, including him and Ward lying to her about her father. Rand says they did so to protect her, but Joy states that she could have protected herself, and she deserved the truth. As Davos steps out of the bathroom, he finds the photographs from [[Mary Walker|Mary]], then tells Joy they need to leave.

Bethany says she understands why he bailed on the dinner the night before, but wants him to channel his best self to help him manage next time.

*Sherry Yang tells the couple that after the debacle the night before, the [[Triad War]] will only intensify. Rand and Wing state that they hope there is a way to restart negotiation. Sherry says the [[Golden Tigers]] have seized the docks, and they could only concede them in an exchange, but cannot allow them to take control. She says there is no other option, and Wing asks if this is coming from her husband, [[Hai-Qing Yang]]. Sherry insists that she speaks for him in his absence, and looks uncomfortable, causing Wing to realize that him being in [[Hong Kong]] was a lie. Yang admits this, saying he has suffered a stroke and that prognosis is negative. Rand is suspicious of the stroke's timing, and Wing asks him to step out briefly, feeling he is being too headstrong.<ref name="IF2/DD3 Late 2017 Placement"/><ref name="IF204"/>
*Wing talks to Sherry Yang about the fact that if they do not stop the Triad War, there will be many Yangsi Gonshi deaths. Meanwhile, Rand investigates the room from which they heard the beeping, where he finds Hai-Qing. Checking his shoulder, he recognizes the [[Devil's Claw]] attack. Hai-Qing awakens and Rand asks him if a man called Davos did this to him. Hai-Qing manages to mutter "Hancock 2-1-2", before his heartbeat becomes erratic. A nurse reenters the room with Sherry and Wing, and Sherry asks them to leave. He tries to ask her what Hai-Qing's words mean, but Liu comes into the room and forces them out.<ref name="IF2/DD3 Late 2017 Placement"/><ref name="IF204"/>

She states that Chang is now in hospital with broken bones, attacked by "some guy with a glowing fist". Knight tells Rand that the faction arriving at the parley were cops, likely a follow team trying to get evidence to take down each Triad's leadership, and the couple messed it up. She asks them to take a step back, but Rand says that something bigger is at play with Davos, with Wing explaining about the induced stroke. Asking Knight what she might know about "Hancock 2-1-2", she replies that [[Hancock Transport]] is a big maritime shipping company, and they realize that Yang likely cancelled a deal with Davos over a shipment to the docks because of the parley. Rand wants to go to the docks, but Knight insists that he leave it to the police, and Wing agrees.

Knight is frustrated at him for staying involved despite her advice, but Rand explains what Davos has done and says he has to track him down, but Knight insists he step down. When Rand becomes angry, Wing tries to calm him, but also says that he has a point, as he might have stopped Davos if he got to the scene earlier. Knight goes to check the corpse, and Wing tells Rand she does not understand why he keeps running in headfirst without stopping to think, pointing out he put a police officer in the hospital the night before because of it. Rand says he thought, because of what she went through with [[Bakuto]], that she would understand how difficult it can be finding out someone you have known for most of your life is capable of such horrible things, and she reluctantly tells him he should go.<ref name="IF2/DD3 Late 2017 Placement"/><ref name="IF204"/>

*[[Joy Meachum]] returns home to find Ward waiting for her outside her apartment.

Joy, however, is angry, not wanting him involved with her, and he is disappointed that his olive branch has failed. She insists she is never coming back to the company or him, kicking him out.

*'''[[Capture of Iron Fist]]''':
**Rand leaves a message, telling Meachum to get as far away from Davos as she can, as he arrives at the subway station. However, as he is walking, he is ambushed by Walker, who manages to use her knowledge of his fighting style to block him and inject him with a sedative. Rand is confused about why she would attack, thinking her to be Mary, and struggles against her attacks. He lights up the Iron Fist and punches the ground to cause a shock wave, but she jumps behind a pillar to avoid it. Rand gets a call from Wing and starts telling her that "It's Mary -" before he is cut off by her hitting it out of his hand.<ref name="IF2/DD3 Late 2017 Placement"/><ref name="IF204"/>

Davos asks where he might find more, and the man tells him of their [[Golden Tigers' Nightclub|nightclub]].

Wing is worried she is keeping Knight from her job, but Knight assures her she has taken some days off to consider her recent offer for a promotion to police captain.

He makes his way over to [[Ho]], and tells him that the [[Triad War]] is over - that he will end it. Ho instructs two of his men to attack, but Davos easily uses their knives to kill them both. Ho stands and goes for his knife, but Davos uses the Iron Fist to punch him into a wall, killing him. As Davos turns to attack the half-blinded [[Chen Wu]], Wu says he can help him by telling him where all the Triads and criminal gangs in the city are.

*Joy and Ward Meachum start to talk at [[Chikara Dojo]], with Ward asking why she would take things out on Rand, and she explains her perspective that Rand ruined her life after returning but came out of it thinking he was a hero.

This implies he was attacked 5 days ago, with Ellison knowing that the attack was 2 days after the event she was referring to just from it being said to be "a week ago". However, the attack is definitively only 2 days prior to the discussion, so it must be taken that Ellison in fact knows when Kazemi made this statement, to then know that it was 2 days before the attack - and Page is rounding up to "a week" from just 4 days.</ref>

*In the elevator alone with Tammy Hattley, Nadeem asks her what Fisk did to sway her, but she says not to engage in conversation, as while there are no mics present, there are cameras. He asks how she could kill [[Winn]], but she says she did it to save his life, and it is his fault for pursuing Poindexter behind her back, as she would have stopped it otherwise. Nadeem wants to find a way out, but Hattley says there is none, and explains that for over a year, Fisk has been interfering with his life - stopping his sister-in-law's health coverage to make him desperate for promotion and therefore susceptible to giving him everyone he wanted.<ref name="IF2/DD3 Late 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DD309"/>
*Leaving the elevator, Nadeem tells Hattley she should have reported Fisk and run away with her family, but she explains that Fisk already had his people kill one of her children to get her under control, and she cannot risk losing her remaining daughter, since Fisk cannot just be escaped.<ref name="IF2/DD3 Late 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DD309"/>

*'''[[Search for Daredevil]]''':
**Poindexter and Nadeem go to Police Captain [[Strieber]], posing as [[FBI]] simply doing their job. Nadeem says Daredevil is their suspect, so he is taking charge. Maggie Grace approaches and explains she saw Daredevil leave the church, but Poindexter claims to have seen him return to the church, allowing them an excuse to still check the building. Nadeem explains they are also looking for a blonde woman named Karen Page.<ref name="IF2/DD3 Late 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DD311"/>
**Murdock follows Page to the basement, locking the crypt gate behind them. She apologizes for not running and they hear the police finding the locked gate, realizing they are safe for the moment, but that the police will be back. Page explains that she had come in hopes of warning him about [[Wilson Fisk]] knowing he is Daredevil, but, frustrated, he tells her he lost his opportunity to get Fisk in coming to help her.

**Poindexter, Nadeem, and the police check the church basement, and find everything seemingly clear. Grace, however, notices one tomb with blood on the corner.

*Hearing them leave, Murdock lifts the tomb lid off and he and Page climb out. Murdock asks Page why Fisk is after her, and she explains about provoking him in hopes of him attacking her in front of the FBI. She expects him to think she is an idiot, but he calls her brave. Page confesses about killing [[James Wesley]], and that being why Poindexter has come for her, and by extension why Lantom is dead, blaming herself. In return, Murdock admits he was going to kill Fisk. She is understanding, but tells him about being responsible for her brother's death and explains that there is no coming back from killing anyone. Murdock questions whether doing it might in fact be his path "back", but she insists doing it would change everything he feels about himself.<ref name="IF2/DD3 Late 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DD311"/>
*Wilson Fisk steps out of the [[Presidential Hotel]] with [[Benjamin Donovan]]. Donovan announces that, 2 years on from his supposedly unjust charges, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals have overturned Fisk's convictions, and Fisk has been freed.

*[[Brett Mahoney]] arrives at the Clinton Church crime scene and tells Ray Nadeem that something is not adding up, since the FBI are claiming Karen Page is Daredevil's accomplice, but witnesses are stating that Daredevil was trying to kill her.

*[[Benjamin Poindexter]] is furious, demanding the FBI take Page, but [[Brett Mahoney]] reminds him that, by law, she is theirs. Nadeem takes Mahoney aside and subtly tells him that Page has to be taken away, as she will be killed by the FBI. Mahoney marches Page away to safety and Nadeem claims to Poindexter that the plan is to have Hattley pull strings to get her back to them, but Poindexter is angry, and tells Nadeem he has messed up in a serious way. All the while, Murdock listens in from nearby, relieved that Page is safe, but hearing the threat to Nadeem.<ref name="IF2/DD3 Late 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DD311"/>
*Fisk arrives at the home of the ''Rabbit in a Snowstorm'' owner, [[Esther Falb]]. She says that more money will not convince her to give it over, and that the government took the painting from her family in [[1940s#1943|1943]]. Fisk explains that the woman he loves gave him the painting, but Falb argues that it was never hers to give, and explains how the Gestapo took it when they stormed her home and killed her father, and most of her family died following that - the painting being a connection to the people she loves as well.

Murdock realizes they do have a candidate.<ref name="IF2/DD3 Late 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DD311"/>

**During the journey, Nadeem asks how Murdock has held onto his friends despite his life as Daredevil, but Murdock explains it is through their kindness, not his.

Nadeem had been expecting someone to come to kill him, and warns Poindexter that Fisk will kill him too when he is done with him. He says he can help cut a deal with the DA to take Fisk down together, but Poindexter refuses, saying Fisk has given him a sense of self. Accepting his fate, since as long as he is alive his family is at risk, Nadeem tells Poindexter that he will not come with him, and if he wants to kill him, he has to do it there.

*[[Brett Mahoney]] picks up Felix Manning, found hanging from the building, who, scared of Daredevil, says he simply "tripped", and Mahoney does not care to investigate someone who is taking down Fisk's men. [[Foggy Nelson]] approaches Mahoney and says that he is compelled to warn Mahoney that he has reason to believe someone will try to kill Fisk that night.

*Nelson gets back to [[Fogwell's Gym]], where he finds [[Karen Page]] watching the press statement. She tell him that while she does not want Murdock to kill Fisk, it might be a necessary measure. Nelson points out that the day before, Murdock had come back to a semblance of his former self, so he has hope he will again, pointing out that if Murdock crosses the line of his Catholic belief in letting people live for a chance at redemption, he will never forgive himself. Nelson gets a call from the [[FBI]] asking for him to come in, and he decides he has to go in, though he and Page worry it is a trap.<ref name="IF2/DD3 Late 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DD313"/>
*Nelson arrives at the [[New York City FBI Office]] and posts a picture to his social media with [[Benjamin Poindexter]], making sure everyone, including the police, know where he is in case something happens. Poindexter assures him he is not in danger, pointing out Fisk will find him useful as the district attorney anyway, and is taken to see [[Seema Nadeem]], who is sitting with Hattley. Seema explains she has come to apologize for her husband's apparent despicable actions and cooperate with the investigation, having called Nelson since he was Ray's lawyer. Seema is allowed to sit with Nelson in private, as Hattley and Poindexter step outside. Hattley is upset by having to lie to Seema, and tells Poindexter she is only doing so because she has to.<ref name="IF2/DD3 Late 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DD313"/>
*Seema Nadeem continues talking to Nelson as if she is buying all of the FBI's claims, but as she speaks, she writes on a notepad that the FBI will be listening with bugs, and then that she has actually come in to save Sami, and is doing so because of an idea Ray left her in a video. Nelson circles the word "video" and adds a question mark to ask what she is referring to, and she indicates it is on the phone she has brought. He says he will help and takes it with him.<ref name="IF2/DD3 Late 2017 Placement"/><ref name="DD313"/>
*Murdock calls Poindexter from Felix Manning's phone and reveals he has listened to his tapes, and that Fisk has killed Julie Barnes, wanting to replace her as his "north star".

*<!--After sunset-->Murdock stands atop the building where Julie Barnes' body is kept, listening as Poindexter enters and checks it. He finds a refrigerated room and, pulling bags of dead bodies, is horrified to find Julie Barnes' body, as Murdock had told him he would. Murdock calls Poindexter again, and Poindexter initially accuses him of being the killer, but Murdock explains Fisk's manipulation, and that he knows Poindexter knows deep down it was Fisk.

**Poindexter throws a shard of glass to sever the chandelier above Fisk from the ceiling, but Fisk dodges it as it falls, as well as Murdock.

In ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'', Thor says, "Sokovia, Ultron, that was 2 years ago." Banner asks, "I've been Hulk for 2 years?", and he replies, "I'm afraid so." Then, later, Banner mentions (from Thor's information) that he was "trapped for 2 years inside of a monster." These refer to it being 2 years since the Battle of Sokovia, dated to May 6, 2015. It has been stated many times, ([https://news.marvel.com/movies/80159/executive-producer-brad-winderbaum-talks-thors-evolution-culminating-thor-ragnarok/ 1], [https://screenrant.com/thor-ragnarok-mcu-movie-timeline/ 2], [https://www.cnet.com/news/comic-con-2017-new-thor-ragnarok-trailer-and-panel-marvel-hulk/ 3], [https://www.pressreader.com/uk/empire-uk/20170901/282471413943844 4], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h3BfDOvzts&t=111s 5], [https://screenrant.com/thor-ragnarok-hulk-design-ruffalo-banner/ 6], [http://collider.com/thor-ragnarok-spoilers-trivia/ 7], [https://nerdist.com/thor-ragnarok-where-were-loki-thor-hulk/ 8], [https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/6/16612840/thor-ragnarok-visual-effects-jake-morrison-interview-hulk 9]) that the events of the film pick up 2 years after the climax or ending of ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', in May-June 2015. [https://www.cnet.com/news/comic-con-2017-new-thor-ragnarok-trailer-and-panel-marvel-hulk/ Tom Hiddleston also said, "It's been 4 years since ''Thor: The Dark World'', and Loki is pretending to be Odin."] This would place the film 4 years after the end of ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'' in November 2013. Overall, the maths weighing up this evidence places the film around July 2017, a little over 2 years after ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', nearly 4 years after ''Thor: The Dark World''.<br>However, ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' places itself firmly in March 2018, by all the evidence given for its placement by the film itself and ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''. This would suggest around 8 months between the films, but the films seem very much to take place only a few months apart, due to implications from the dialogue in the ''Thor: Ragnarok'' credits scene, the identical state of the Asgardians, and the fact the characters are physically no different (hair, beards, outfits, etc.). Overall, the math places ''Thor: Ragnarok'' as occurring around mid-to-late November 2017, 4 months before ''Avengers: Infinity War''.

====24th====
*Fitz receives the December 2017 edition of ''Ballblaster Hooligan'', publishing another of his letters for the sixth consecutive time.<ref name="AoS5 Ballblaster Hooligan"/><ref name="AoS505"/>

====25th====
*On his 197th morning in prison, Fitz is taken for another session of questioning.<ref name="AoS505 November 2017">In ''Rewind'', it is shown that when Hunter visits Fitz in prison, he has just drawn his 197th monkey face on the wall of his cell, making it the 197th morning after May 12, 2017, which is November 25, 2017. Therefore, the main events of ''Rewind'' take place November 25-26, 2017.</ref><ref name="AoS505"/>
*In the interrogation room, [[Leo Fitz]] is confronted by Lieutenants [[Evans]] and [[Lucas]], who remind him that in the last 6 months, he has not brought them a single plausible theory. Fitz posits in sincerity that his friends may, in fact, have been abducted by aliens. Tired of his failures and finding this theory ridiculous, the lieutenants' superior, General Hale, enters and angrily threatens to have him locked up for good. However, at that moment, she receives a call informing her that Fitz's "attorney" has arrived and is demanding to see his client.<ref name="AoS505 November 2017"/><ref name="AoS505"/>
*Fitz's supposed attorney enters the room, and Fitz is relieved to see that it is in fact [[Lance Hunter]], who picked up on the messages he left him in ''Ballblaster Hooligan''. Once they are left alone, they talk briefly and begin to argue, with Fitz saying Hunter took too long, but in the end Fitz hugs him, happy to see him after over a year-and-a-half of Hunter being unable to contact them.<ref name="AoS505 November 2017"/><ref name="AoS505"/>
*'''[[Escape from Blue Raven Ridge]]''':
**Hunter reveals to Fitz that the place they are in is a military compound, and informs him that he plans to break him out. Fitz begins to tell him a plan he came up with for escape, but Hunter simply detonates one of the walls, allowing them to leave the room, having already put a plan in place.<ref name="AoS505 November 2017"/><ref name="AoS505"/>
**Hunter's associate, [[Rusty Peltzer]], attempts to distract the military by flying a helicopter overhead. However, Peltzer clumsily loses control of the vehicle and crashes to the ground, dying in an explosion.<ref name="AoS505 November 2017"/><ref name="AoS505"/>
**The crash nonetheless causes a distraction, and the duo take the opportunity to get away, escaping in an RV that Peltzer had given to Hunter.<ref name="AoS505 November 2017"/><ref name="AoS505"/>
*Lieutenants [[Lucas]] and [[Evans]] inform their boss, General Hale, that there was nothing suspicious in Fitz's letters and that they therefore do not know how he managed to make contact with someone on the outside. They then show Hale that they have found footage of the van the duo escaped in, and Hale orders them to track the pair, but not to engage them.<ref name="AoS505 November 2017"/><ref name="AoS505"/>
*Hunter gives Fitz back his cell phone, and he scrolls through articles, finding that the news is still reporting S.H.I.E.L.D. as a hostile organization following the [[Attack on the S.H.I.E.L.D. International Inquiry|attack on the international inquiry]] by a [[Daisy Johnson (Life-Model Decoy)|Daisy Johnson LMD]]. He asks Hunter about [[Bobbi Morse]], and Hunter reveals that they are still a couple, but are taking some time apart to operate individually. Fitz then mentions that the only lead they have on the agents' abduction is a beer van outside [[Rae's Restaurant]] from that night, and Hunter tells him that Rusty Peltzer kept equipment for tapping into security footage in the back of the RV.<ref name="AoS505 November 2017"/><ref name="AoS505"/>
*Fitz rushes to look at Peltzer's tech, but when he does, he discovers that the security footage blacked out during his friends' abduction. He realizes, however, that several similar vans appearing in security footage before and after the abduction may in fact be the one same van, somehow changing its appearance, and confirms this using a structural analysis that proves they are identical. Following the van's route using the security footage, they track the person responsible back to his home.<ref name="AoS505 November 2017"/><ref name="AoS505"/>
*Hunter and Fitz drive to the abductor's house and raid the home, finding a man inside and holding him at gunpoint. He calmly introduces himself as [[Enoch]], an alien [[Chronicoms|Chronicom]], and explains that the group are in the year [[2091]], saying that a "seer" told him about needing to send the agents to the future, as well as that Fitz needed to stay behind. Fitz becomes aggressive, pressuring Enoch to reveal who and where the seer is, and the alien tells them he will take them to see her.<ref name="AoS505 November 2017"/><ref name="AoS505"/>
*Fitz and Hunter are taken to meet the seer in a park, finding that she is [[Robin Hinton]], [[Charles Hinton]]'s daughter, who has undergone [[Terrigenesis]] at a young age and acquired abilities to see past, present, and future, similar to her father's foresight. She is sitting with her mother, [[Polly Hinton|Polly]], who Fitz remembers from the incident last year. He introduces himself to the two of them.<ref name="AoS505 November 2017"/><ref name="AoS505">''[[Rewind (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 5.05: Rewind]]''</ref>
*Meanwhile, Evans and Lucas track Fitz and Hunter to Enoch's house and break in to investigate. They find no one present, but discover a child's drawings in the kitchen, depicting the two of them in the kitchen in the exact same scenario they are currently in. Evans realizes that their suspicions that S.H.I.E.L.D. had some sort of foreseeing technology were incorrect, as in fact, the seer is a child.<ref name="AoS505 November 2017"/><ref name="AoS505"/>
*The two lieutenants manage to track down Fitz, Hunter, Enoch, and the Hintons and arrive at the park. However, using the same [[Chronicoms|Chronicom]] technology he used to capture the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] team 6 months prior, Enoch immobilizes them where they stand for half an hour, so as to allow them to escape. When lieutenants return to consciousness and mobility, it is as if no time has passed and the group vanished, but Lucas realizes what happened to them after checking his watch.<ref name="AoS505 November 2017"/><ref name="AoS505"/>
*[[Enoch]] drives the group to the location where the other agents are staying in 2091: the [[Lighthouse]] at [[Lake Ontario]].<ref name="AoS505 November 2017"/><ref name="AoS505"/>

====26th====
*In the early morning, Fitz, Hunter, Enoch, and the Hintons arrive at the Lighthouse.<ref name="AoS505 November 2017"/><ref name="AoS505"/>
*General [[Hale]] is delivered Hinton's drawings. She tells Lieutenants Evans and Lucas to make finding the seer a priority.<ref name="AoS505 November 2017"/><ref name="AoS505"/>
*Enoch informs Fitz and Hunter that sending the agents to the future was part of a plan to stop some sort of extinction-level event, but that the details of this event are unknown.<ref name="AoS505 November 2017"/><ref name="AoS505"/>
*Fitz and Hunter discuss Fitz's relationship with [[Jemma Simmons]], and Fitz comments that he fears the universe wants to keep him and Simmons apart. Hunter says this is nonsense, but Fitz claims that it might even be best for everyone, as he is struggling with the part of himself which still feels like the [[Framework]] version of himself - having caused him to become aggressive towards Enoch.<ref name="AoS505 November 2017"/><ref name="AoS505"/>
*Deciding to try again to find out why he was left behind, Fitz goes to speak to Robin Hinton and Polly, who explains to Fitz that Robin can only communicate her seeings through drawings, as when her powers are in use, she can become scatterbrained. Robin hands Fitz a new drawing, explaining that his purpose is to save his fellow agents after they are done helping in 2091, and bring them back to present day.<ref name="AoS505 November 2017"/><ref name="AoS505"/>
*Fitz discusses with [[Enoch]] how he could get to [[2091]], and Enoch reveals that he used a capsule thousands of years ago to get to Earth, and that if Fitz can find this, it might be able to help him. He says, however, that it is being housed in a compound called [[Blue Raven Ridge]], which Hunter explains to Fitz is the exact compound they just escaped from. Fitz reluctantly decides that they will simply have to break back in.<ref name="AoS505 November 2017"/><ref name="AoS505"/>
*'''[[Infiltration into Blue Raven Ridge]]''':
**[[Leo Fitz]] and [[Lance Hunter]] pose as repairmen to drive into Blue Raven Ridge. They then release ferrets to set off the perimeter alarms, causing the guards to go to protect the border, looking for anyone trying to escape, thus leaving the duo free to break into a warehouse in the compound.<ref name="AoS505 November 2017"/><ref name="AoS505"/>
**In the warehouse, the two find the capsule stored away. They then realize that the warehouse is also housing not only [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] weaponry, but [[Zephyr One]] itself, which will help their escape.<ref name="AoS505 November 2017"/><ref name="AoS505"/>
**Hunter and Fitz load the capsule onto Zephyr One, but as soon as they have, soldiers arrive in the warehouse to stop them. Fitz uses an [[I.C.E.R.]] found in the warehouse to start firing at them, while Hunter launches the plane. Fitz then jumps on-board as the plane takes off, and the two manage to escape through the open roof, flying away.<ref name="AoS505 November 2017"/><ref name="AoS505"/>
*General [[Hale]] meets with Lieutenants [[Evans]] and [[Lucas]] and berates them for repeatedly failing her. They believe they are being demoted, but Hale instead simply shoots them both through the head.<ref name="AoS505 November 2017"/><ref name="AoS505"/>
*Knowing that the [[Lighthouse]] will eventually become the base populated by the [[Kree]] and the final remnants of humanity, where his friends are fighting in the future, Fitz stores the S.H.I.E.L.D. weaponry inside a wall, to retrieve in 2091. He then reveals to Hunter what the plan is: the capsule is a cryogenic chamber, and he will sleep in freeze for 74 years, to wake up biologically still young in 2091. He writes a note on the back of a Lake Ontario postcard saying, "Working on it - Fitz", which he leaves with [[Robin Hinton]], hoping his friends will get his message.<ref name="AoS505 November 2017"/><ref name="AoS505"/>
*When [[Lance Hunter]] expresses his worry that the capsule cannot be kept safe for 74 years, Enoch clarifies that he will take Fitz in the capsule with him in a ship, and will orbit a planet a safe distance from Earth for 74 years, trying not to be discovered. Hunter offers to help [[Polly Hinton|Polly]] and Robin Hinton for the foreseeable future in his stead, with the help of [[Bobbi Morse]], which Enoch is grateful for. Hunter wishes Fitz well, telling him what he always told Morse: "Don't die out there." Fitz then enters the chamber, and as it begins to freeze, Hunter jokingly quotes ''{{WPS|The Empire Strikes Back|Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back}}'', saying, "I love you," and Fitz responds in kind with a joking, "I know". [[Leo Fitz]] is frozen, beginning 74 years of cryostasis.<ref name="AoS505 November 2017"/><ref name="AoS505"/>

===December===
====3rd====
*[[Ruby Hale]] skips class at the [[HYDRA Preparatory Academy]].<ref>In ''[[All the Comforts of Home]]'', Hale says on December 4, 2017 that Ruby "skipped class yesterday", making it December 3, 2017.</ref><ref name="AoS511"/>

====4th====
*In the morning, General [[Hale]] visits her daughter, Ruby, in her bedroom. She confronts her about having skipped class yesterday and Ruby says that she simply does not care about her classes, but when Hale threatens to take her cell phone if she does not go, Ruby reluctantly agrees. Before her mother leaves, Ruby suddenly asks her if she is a "good guy". Hale asks her why she is questioning this, and Ruby explains that she understands her mother is going after [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], but that since S.H.I.E.L.D. were always considered good until recently, she is questioning her mother's behavior. Hale realizes that Ruby is asking because of her obsession with the hero "[[Quake]]", who worked for S.H.I.E.L.D., and explains that she simply has to try to capture her since it is her assignment from her superiors, and that her motive is always to help build a better world for everyone, but most importantly Ruby. She promises that when the agents resurface, she will find them and put an end to all the problems they cause.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement">In ''[[The Real Deal]]'', 2 days after the agents return from 2091, the date is shown on Yo-Yo Rodriguez's medical monitor to be "12-06-2017" - December 6, 2017, meaning they return on December 4, 2017. This matches with:
*''[[All the Comforts of Home]]'' being soon after the main events of ''Rewind'' on November 25-26, 2017, 197 days (as given by the number of monkey faces Fitz has drawn on his cell wall) after Fitz was incarcerated on May 12, 2017 and the day after.
*In ''All the Comforts of Home'', the events of ''Thor: Ragnarok'' are referenced as being recent, with ''Thor: Ragnarok'' taking place around November 2017.
*In ''The Real Deal'', Hale says, "This is the first time Ms. Johnson's been sighted in months," suggesting it is still 2017 and not yet the new year and working well as 7 months since their disappearance in May 2017.
*A couple of weeks later, in ''[[Principia (episode)|Principia]]'', Coulson jokes with Fitz asking if he comes bearing "tidings of comfort and joy", suggesting it is Christmas time.
*A couple of weeks later, in ''Principia'', a "12-17-2017" date is shown on Rodriguez's monitor.</ref><ref name="AoS511"/>
*<!--07:05-->Just after 7AM local time, [[Phil Coulson]]'s agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. materialize from being transported through time by the [[White Monolith]] that engulfed them in [[2091]]. They are initially confused by the fact that they are still in the [[Lighthouse]], but [[Leo Fitz]] realizes that while they have not moved in space, they have indeed been sent back in time, recognizing the 2017 layout of the base from his time with [[Enoch]].<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS511"/>
*<!--07:05-->Fitz activates the electricity, which triggers a projected video of [[1970s]] S.H.I.E.L.D. agent General [[Rick Stoner]], in which Stoner explains that the Lighthouse is the world's last bastion designed for the initiation of the [[Project Reclamation]] protocol at the time of a world-ending event. [[Jemma Simmons]] and [[Yo-Yo Rodriguez]] go to tend to [[Alphonso Mackenzie]]'s injuries, while Leo Fitz and [[Melinda May]] head to the basement to find a storage facility that Stoner's video describes as housing S.H.I.E.L.D. technology. Coulson stays to be there when [[Daisy Johnson]] wakes.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS511"/>
*<!--07:10-->Johnson comes to and expresses her annoyance at Coulson for having [[I.C.E.R.|I.C.E.]]-d her, saying that he should not have taken her considering the severe risk, but he tells her he does not care, because he simply needed her to be with them.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS511"/>
*<!--07:15-->Arriving at the basement storage facility, May and Fitz are puzzled when they find three new, different Monoliths. May asks where they might be from, and the agents are startled when a response comes from across the room, saying, "Unknown." The speaker reveals himself to be another [[Chronicoms|Chronicom]] named [[Noah]], and he explains that the Monoliths are housed in the Lighthouse to both protect them and to protect others from them.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS511"/>
*<!--07:20-->Noah takes the duo to his control room, from which he monitors potential threats to the planet, noting a well-known politician attempting to delete his [[FBI]] files and the recent appearance of an [[Asgardians|Asgardian]] in [[New York City]], having followed the news surrounding [[Thor]]'s brief visit. May spots a live feed from [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], where, in the pre-dawn darkness, some sort of beam can be seen coming down from the sky to an [[St. Louis Aerospace Facility|aerospace facility]], and worries that it could be a harbinger of the events leading to the [[Destruction of Earth|destruction of Earth]].<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS511"/>
*<!--07:30-->Having been called in by May, the rest of the team arrive in the control room, and Coulson expresses the same concerns: that this beam could be the "light from the sky" that [[Samuel Voss]] warned them about that leads to the end of the world. Noah informs them that the wavelength of the beam is unusual, so it could very well be alien, and the team decide to travel to St. Louis to investigate, with Fitz informing them that he and Hunter left [[Zephyr One]] cloaked nearby and he can take them to it. Johnson elects to stay behind, worried that she is a liability if she leaves the Lighthouse. Noah shows them secret tunnels that will take the team from the Lighthouse to a nearby New York town called [[River's End]], where they can safely leave without attracting attention.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS511"/>
*<!--07:55-->The team get out into the sunlight and fresh air for the first time in days, and take a moment to appreciate it. They notice a van for sale nearby and decide that they need to take it to get to Zephyr One. Mackenzie is reluctant to steal, but Coulson assures him they will return it after.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS511"/>
*[[Daisy Johnson]] uses one of Noah's computers to set up an alert in case any of her friends have been spotted.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS511"/>
*As Mackenzie drives them, the team light-heartedly discuss how things could be worse, mentioning the numerous bad things they've had to deal with over the years: being enslaved by [[Kasius]], the [[Framework]], Fitz and Simmons getting stuck at the bottom of the ocean, stopping [[Aida]], fighting both of Johnson's parents, and, for May, having to loosen up and dance at the [[Hotel La Ona]].<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS511"/>
*Johnson's research leads her to finding that their team are not just wanted fugitives, but they are "most wanted", with police departments everywhere having their pictures.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS511"/>
*While driving, the team are pulled over by a police officer driving past. They become concerned as the officer mentions recognizing the van as belonging to [[John Nickel]], afraid that he will arrest them for stealing, but he then simply asks how much they paid for it, noting that Nickel had failed to sell it for ages. The group are relieved as they drive off, grateful that they are in a quiet town.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS511"/>
*Just after the agents have driven away, [[Deke Shaw]] materializes in River's End, having also been sent back in time after being hit by a shard of the [[White Monolith]] in the blast in [[2091]] as he was helping [[Enoch]]. He is immediately awestruck by the beauty of nature in 2017, pre-[[Destruction of Earth|destruction of Earth]], and cannot help but walk to a nearby tree and hug it, wanting to learn what trees feel and smell like. A nearby woman looks at him in confusion and he tells her he has just never seen anything like it, but she believes he must be on drugs.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS511"/>
*Shaw sees a nearby bar and excitedly walks over and enters, wanting to see what a real bar is like. He is pleased to see that his [[Framework]] approximation was reasonably close to real life and asks the bartender for a beer, but when he tries it, he is disappointed by how it tastes after years of wondering. The bartender gives him a {{WPS|Zima (drink)|Zima}} instead, and Shaw loves it, asking for more and more and getting drunk, fascinated as he tries out arcade games and flicking through channels on the television.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS511"/>
*Shaw goes to leave the bar, but the bartender stops him to ask him for payment. Shaw drunkenly holds out his [[Metrics|Metric]], confusing the bartender, and the man tells him that he is happy to take either card or cash, reminding Shaw of the 2010s payment system. Realizing he could be in trouble, Shaw tries to run away, but in his inebriated state, he simply trips on a pool table, falling over and muttering that he is from the future as he passes out.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS511"/>
*The team arrive at [[Zephyr One]], leaving John Nickel's van with a note for it to be returned and boarding the plane.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS511"/>
*On-board, [[Melinda May]] tells [[Phil Coulson]] she is feeling very glad to be back to flying in normal gravity. Coulson then doubles over in pain, but when May asks if he okay, he waves it off as just a headache. [[Leo Fitz]] and [[Jemma Simmons]] then call him over, showing Coulson that the perceived direction that the beam over [[St. Louis]] was traveling in was a result of the low frame rate they were watching at, and that once the rate is increased, it can be seen that it is in fact traveling from the [[St. Louis Aerospace Facility]] upward into the sky. They then explain that from this discovery, they recognized the beam, telling Coulson that it is in fact the same beacon that [[Hive]] had used to summon the [[Kree]].<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS511"/>
*[[Alphonso Mackenzie]] sits with [[Yo-Yo Rodriguez]] and reassures her over her worries from meeting her future self, saying that [[Kasius]] used that version of her to manipulate them so she should not trust what she heard too strictly, and asserting that they will change the future anyway.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS511">''[[All the Comforts of Home|Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D: 5.11: All the Comforts of Home]]''</ref>
*[[Robert Minoru]] buys an apartment for him and [[Janet Stein]], his secret lover.<ref name="R103"/>
*Johnson gets an alert from the local police and is shocked when she finds that the arrested individual is [[Deke Shaw]], believing him to have remained in [[2091]]. She realizes that since they are the only people Shaw knows in 2017, he might end up spilling their secrets, and reluctantly decides to go to pick him up from the police station.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS511"/>
*The team arrive at St. Louis Aerospace Facility and enter with caution when Fitz finds the heat signature of a person inside. However, the group are relieved when they find that it is Agent [[Piper]], who appears happy to see them after months of searching with no avail.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS511"/>
*Deke Shaw is rambling to the police officers about being from the future when [[Daisy Johnson]] arrives, claiming to be his support officer. When the officers ask her name, she goes with the first that comes to mind: her opponent from 2091, "Sinara", adding "Smith" as a surname.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS511"/>
*[[Candice Lee]] informs her boss, General [[Hale]], that they have received a call about the location of Coulson's agents of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]. She instructs Lee to reply to the informant that they need to be kept at the location.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS511"/>
*Piper explains to the group that she never heard what happened to them after their encounter with [[Aida]] and asks where they were hiding all this time, but Coulson says they will explain later. She tells them that she had worked out the beacon was [[Hive]]'s, pointing out that she remembered it from the [[Battle of Union City]] as that mission had been her first among the higher ranks and had meant a lot to her, then she had come to the facility to warn workers and prepare for any incoming Kree. As they speak, the beacon suddenly starts up again.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS511"/>
*Johnson retrieves Shaw from the station, improvising the details of her fake identity as she is forced to fill out the necessary paperwork. Shaw explains what happened with the Monolith shard in 2091, and Johnson is surprised when Shaw's tone does not come across as upset or in shock. He tells her that he is excited because he had thought he was going to die, yet had not only survived but ended up in a world with outdoors and air and sunshine.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS511"/>
*'''[[Infiltration into St. Louis Aerospace Facility]]''':
**Fitz manages to deactivate the beacon, finding that someone installed a power source by hand. [[Piper]] suddenly pulls a gun on them, revealing that it was her, as the beacon had been activated to lure them in. A group of [[Sleeper Mechs|figures]] looking like men in black armor arrive at the facility to take the agents, with a leader dressed in grey.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS511"/>
**Piper explains that she had been found by General [[Hale]] but had made a deal to set a trap the rest of the agents, under the promise that if she helped take them in then they would be guaranteed safety. However, in the next room, the leader in grey gives the order for the soldiers to kill the agents. [[Yo-Yo Rodriguez]] uses her super-speed to disarm the soldiers, so instead of shooting them, a fight breaks out between the two groups. Piper is confused as she had been told the mission was "capture, not kill".<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS511"/>
**As the fight continues, [[Alphonso Mackenzie]] shoots one soldier in the face, and the damaged helmet reveals that underneath is not a human but an android. Piper tells [[Phil Coulson]] that she had trusted Hale as a member of the [[United States Armed Forces]], but he says she has been deceived. Realizing her mistake, she tells the group she will cover for them as they make their escape.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS511"/>
**Rodriguez sees Mackenzie being beaten by an android across the room and uses her super-speed to run at him, but just as she does so, the leader in grey throws a [[vibranium]] [[Ring Blades|Ring Blade]] at her. It is perfectly timed to catch her as she runs, and the ring slices through both of Rodriguez's arms.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS511"/>
**Mackenzie rushes to Rodriguez's aid as she stands in shock. He finds a blanket to wrap her in and carries her away with the rest of the group as they escape the [[St. Louis Aerospace Facility]]. She mutters that the future they visited is already coming true.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS511"/>
*[[Deke Shaw]] and [[Daisy Johnson]] return to the [[Lighthouse]], and Johnson gets a call from [[Melinda May]].

*[[Ruby Hale]], who had been the figure dressed in grey leading the androids, gets back to her mother, who is waiting in her bedroom. General [[Hale]] asks her what she was thinking in letting the agents go and cutting off Rodriguez's arms. Ruby explains that she had been promised a chance to deal with Daisy Johnson, and since she was not there, she had chosen instead to force them to seek medical attention, hoping it will get the group where they need them to be, as well as claiming that her attack will make Johnson more desperate to be involved in the future and join the rest of the group. Hale says she is sloppy. Ruby claims that it does not matter, because the group took the beacon, which had been set up as a trap as a back-up plan. Hale says, however, that they should not have had to resort to the beacon, calling her daughter a disappointment before leaving her room, which is in fact a part of the HYDRA Preparatory Academy.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS511"/>
*[[Daisy Johnson]] goes to find [[Leo Fitz]] in the basement storage facility to make certain he has checked they are not being trapped. He says he has, and that they are currently just waiting for its internal circuitry to cool down. Noah continues monitoring it and notices, however, that the circuitry is instead heating up. Realizing that it is set to explode, he instructs the agents to run. They escape just in time as the beacon detonates.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS511"/>

*In [[Philadelphia]], [[Carl Creel]] is out running when General [[Hale]] stops him in a car. He says he is not interesting in working for her, but she tells him she does not want to use him, but rather is "putting together a team". He reluctantly opens the car door and gets in.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS511"/>
*[[Leo Fitz]] sends a [[D.W.A.R.F.s|D.W.A.R.F.]] to investigate the wreckage of the basement storage facility. The drone finds a rift, created by the simultaneous destruction of the Monoliths, which blew a hole in spacetime and is causing the bleeding of [[Fear Dimension|another dimension]] into theirs. The D.W.A.R.F. is then swatted out of the air, however, by a being exactly resembling [[Lash]].<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS512"/>
*Fitz shows [[Phil Coulson]] and [[Melinda May]] that another of his D.W.A.R.F.s had flown down to a level 150 feet below them, and yet when the elevator doors opened, it had found a forest behind the doors. He explains the rift to another dimension that the D.W.A.R.F. in the basement found, and how that must somehow have caused the strange anomaly. The group worry that while this could mean [[Daisy Johnson]] is not behind the end of the world, that would only be because this rift could in fact already be the beginning of the end.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS512"/>
*[[Jemma Simmons]] tends to [[Yo-Yo Rodriguez]] as she lies in the hospital bed they have set up for her. When [[Alphonso Mackenzie]] arrives, Simmons leaves to allow them some private time together. Mackenzie promises he will do everything he can to help Rodriguez and apologizes for struggling to remain calm, as he could not bear watching her be dismembered, especially after everything they had just been through in [[2091]]. They discuss the upcoming problems they may have to face together, as Rodriguez points out that everything her future self told her appears to be coming true.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS512"/>

====6th====
*[[Deke Shaw]] and Daisy Johnson pick up items from the supply pantry. Shaw is fascinated by orange-scented spray, mistakenly spraying it into his own mouth, exasperating Johnson. He explains to her how hard it was to acquire fruit in the future, but that his [[Mrs. Shaw|mother]] would find him an orange every year for his birthday. He asks Johnson about her parents, but she explains that she grew up in an orphanage, and he apologizes for asking her about a touchy subject.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS512"/>
*Suddenly, the pair are ambushed by what appears to be a [[Kree]] warrior, whose presence they do not understand. They fight back, but the Kree beats Shaw and moves to kill him. Before he can finish the attack, Johnson manages to shoot the warrior through the head, and it further confuses them when the warrior then dissolves into wisps of smoke.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS512"/>
*With the agents back together in the control room, [[Leo Fitz]] explains to them his conclusion: the dimension seeping through the rift is some sort of "Fear Dimension", which can understand their thoughts and physically manifest beings to represent their greatest fears. He shows the team that he has salvaged further footage from the basement D.W.A.R.F., and has found video of what appears to be Lash, which May affirms would indeed be her greatest fear, with Johnson explaining the Kree Warrior is hers, and Shaw saying the forest, as the overwhelming opposite of the dark, enclosed, and lifeless space he has lived his whole life, is his.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS512"/>
*Fitz explains that he thinks he might know how to close the rift, but that his only current idea might involve someone having to sacrifice themselves. He turns to Deke Shaw, who panics, thinking he is asking for him to be the one to die, but Fitz calmly clarifies he is simply requesting his [[Gravity Puck]] belt buckle, as he thinks he can modify it to use the gravitonium inside to force the rift to close. [[Phil Coulson]] then insists that he will be the one to take the risk of taking the device to the rift.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS512"/>
*The team stop Coulson as he tries to walk away, angrily telling him he cannot just make the decision for them. [[Daisy Johnson]] says she wants to go instead, since her being around is already putting everyone at risk, but Coulson insists she is needed to help lead [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] in the future. Johnson becomes distressed, telling him there is no longer a "S.H.I.E.L.D.", just scraps of a team who are wanted criminals and barely holding together, but he stubbornly tells her that the idea that S.H.I.E.L.D. represents is vital. However, as he tries to make his point, he loses his breath and suddenly collapses, confusing the rest of the team.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS512"/>
*After Coulson wakes, the rest of the team wait for him in the control room to discuss Simmons' medical analysis of him. Before he goes to them, Coulson sends Deke Shaw away on a secret mission outdoors, as he is the only one of them who is not on the wanted list.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS512"/>
*Coulson gets back to the control room, and [[Jemma Simmons]] delivers the news of what she has found. She struggles to tell them, choking on her words as she tries not to cry, that Coulson's necrotic tissue from his death in [[2012]] is branching out from his lungs again, as if his resurrection is being undone. Coulson confesses that when he made the deal with [[Ghost Rider]] to take on the [[Spirit of Vengeance]], he had known the cost: the spirit would burn through the [[GH.325]] formula's reviving effects on his dead tissue. Simmons adds that since the tissue is already dead, there is no curing it, and Coulson is dying again.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS512"/>
*The team struggle to come to terms with their leader and friend's coming death, with Johnson letting out her emotions by angrily asking him why he did not tell them before. He explains that he felt their ongoing issues were more pressing, but Johnson points out that in [[2091]], they had an option for saving him, the way [[Tess]] had been revived. Coulson says he did not want to go through an unnatural [[Kree]] revival again, but Johnson claims he had no right to just give up, especially when he makes decisions about their lives and deaths all the time, saying they deserved to be involved in the decision-making in return, before walking off in tears. Simmons says she cannot know how long Coulson has left until she can chart the necrotic tissue's progression, but that at some point, his heart will simply stop beating.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS512"/>
*Coulson follows after Johnson to comfort her, as she is hurting the most of all of them. She says that she cannot take on the responsibility he is giving her. He reassures her that she has always been capable of more than she imagined, but she says that everything she has built in the past few years has been because of him and what he gave to her, so she does not feel any confidence without him. She cries, saying there is not just no S.H.I.E.L.D. without him, but there is simply nothing in their lives without him, and she desperately hugs him, weeping into his shoulder.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS512"/>
*At 6:43AM, Rodriguez lies in her hospital bed and is visited by what appears to be Simmons. "Simmons" begins to speak cruelly, telling Rodriguez that she is causing [[Alphonso Mackenzie]] suffering and should spare them all, shocking Rodriguez. "Simmons", who is an [[LMD]] manifested by the [[Fear Dimension]], suddenly begins to smother her with her pillow in an attempt to kill her. Mackenzie arrives at that moment and attacks the manifestation, knocking its face off to reveal the LMD robotics underneath. The real Jemma Simmons follows him into the room, accompanied by [[Leo Fitz]], and shoots the LMD, and it dissolves into smoke just like the Kree warrior. Fitz tells them that this means the rift is spreading even further, and they have to seal it urgently.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS512"/>
*[[Deke Shaw]] heads out into [[River's End]], and finds [[United States Armed Forces]] military throughout the town, searching for the agents.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS512"/>
*General [[Hale]] sits with one of the officers who arrested Shaw 2 days prior, who tells her that his colleague believes the woman who came to pick up Shaw looked like [[Daisy Johnson]] from the wanted posters. Hale tells him she is greatly appreciative of the lead, as Johnson has not been sighted in months.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS512"/>
*Shaw goes to use a public phone for the first time, to make a call as Coulson instructed him to do.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS512"/>
*Hale asks the officer about Deke Shaw, but he tells her that he was drunk and disorderly and did not seem particularly intelligent.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS512"/>
*Shaw makes a call to "Fiona", but cannot get through.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS512"/>
*The officer tells Hale that when they looked up Shaw, they could find no history behind his name.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS512"/>
*Shaw leaves a pawn shop, which is also selling an [[Iron Man]] helmet toy, [[Thor]] and [[Hawkeye]] figurines, a [[Hulk]] mask, an axe, and a cello, with the items Coulson sent him to pick up. As he walks out, he accidentally bumps into one of Hale's agents, who becomes suspicious of him.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS512"/>
*Coulson reassures May that he is at peace with his death, but that he is not giving up otherwise and will do his absolute best to make it back out of the basement after closing the rift.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS512">''[[The Real Deal|Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D: 5.12: The Real Deal]]''</ref>
*[[Leo Fitz]] prepares [[Phil Coulson]] to head downstairs to the rift, giving him a gun to deal with any potential fear manifestations and the [[Gravity Containment Device|device]] he has made out of Shaw's [[Gravity Puck]]. Coulson tells him that if he does not return, Fitz needs to make sure he proceeds with the secret thing they have been planning. Fitz is dismissive, saying what they are planning is simply symbolic, but Coulson reminds him that symbols and institutions can be very important.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS512"/>
*Coulson takes the elevator down to the basement, but as he steps out into the corridor, the team lose visual contact with him.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS512"/>
*Having prepared to see manifestations of fears, Coulson is taken aback when he instead finds what appears to be [[Mike Peterson (Illusion)|Mike Peterson]] in the basement. "Peterson" tells Coulson that he is here to explain the truth to him of what has really been happening. "Peterson" begins to tell Coulson that his own brain is making everything up, saying that Coulson has never actually been to any of the places he thinks he has been in the last few years.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS512"/>
*Without visual contact, the team become anxious about Coulson. [[Daisy Johnson]] wants to go down after him, but Fitz tells her that they cannot risk losing two people. May assures them that he will make it back, and they just need to hold on.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS512"/>
*"Peterson" tells Coulson that the reason his mind has manifested all these supposed fantasies of years of adventures is that he is in fact still on the operating table in [[2012]] following [[Loki]] stabbing him through the chest, and as his brain is stimulated by electricity trying to revive him, his conscience is trying to make sense of random synapses firing off. "Peterson" claims that he is just an emergency medical technician Coulson barely registered in his near-dead state and his brain incorporated into these fantasies, and says that Coulson's experience of his head catching fire was merely the pain of the electrodes on his brain, and that his Framework life as a history teacher was just a memory of his father's profession. Coulson defies him, saying that the man is just the physical manifestation of his fear of death, but "Peterson" continues that his mind is just creating this story to satisfy him with the adventures he missed out on experiencing when his life was cut short.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS512"/>
*The agents in the control room scan an aircraft incoming and are worried that Hale's people have found them. However, as they check the scan, they realize it is a [[Quinjet]], which then radios in asking permission to land. The team are confused and still cautious, going to meet the landing jet with guns at the ready, but when the door opens, they find [[Deke Shaw]] inside having gathered a group of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents for support, including Agent [[Davis (Agent)|Davis]], whom they had thought dead, and the real [[Deathlok]].<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS512"/>
*'''[[Closure of the Fear Dimension's Rift]]''': "Peterson" attempts to convince [[Phil Coulson]] to walk into the rift, to supposedly accept the fake nature of his reality and give in to his death, but Coulson manages to remain steadfast in his belief in his life and the people around him, telling "Peterson" that he is not buying his story. The manifestation goes to grab him and force him into the rift, but at that moment, the real Peterson arrives in the basement and blasts him from the corner. The [[Fear Dimension]] begins to create various further illusions to fight back against the threat of Coulson closing the rift, manifesting forms of [[Lash (Illusion)|Lash]] and [[Vrellnexians]]. Coulson and Deathlok work together to shoot and dissolve each illusion, however, until Coulson manages to throw Fitz's [[gravitonium]] [[Gravity Containment Device|device]] into the rift, beginning to close it. In one last attack, the dimension creates [[Hive (Illusion)|Hive]] to take down the men in retaliation, but Deathlok blasts the illusion through the head, and the rift finally closes.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS512"/>
*[[Candice Lee]] reports back to General [[Hale]] that they, too, have been unable to find anything from [[Deke Shaw]]'s fingerprints or DNA. She also passes on that they have had further reports of [[Daisy Johnson]] being sighted, but Hale says that either Johnson will have left by now, or S.H.I.E.L.D. might be luring them into a trap, telling Lee that instead, they should pack up their investigation.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS512"/>
*Phil Coulson, [[Leo Fitz]], and [[Deke Shaw]] take the elevator together. Fitz explains that the device is working, at least temporarily, keeping the rift closed, saying the anomalies are fading and no more are currently occurring. He says they have one man to thank for their success, and Shaw mistakenly believes they are talking about him, thanking them for appreciating his efforts and proudly saying how he did everything Coulson asked, circulating fake sightings of Daisy Johnson, collecting the other agents, and picking up everything from the checklist of items for the evening's plans, exaggerating the hardships he had to overcome to perform the simple tasks. Fitz explains that he thought it was obvious that he was talking about Deathlok, and asks Coulson if he will be staying around, but Coulson explains Peterson will be leaving tonight. Fitz continues to ask him about the basement, but Coulson stops him, saying he thinks he is stalling due to nerves for what they are about to do. He straightens Fitz's suit and the elevator doors open onto the illusion forest, which has not yet disappeared, where the rest of the team are waiting to hold what they have been preparing for all day: Leo Fitz and [[Jemma Simmons]]' wedding.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS512"/>
*Fitz walks into the forest, where [[Alphonso Mackenzie]] is filming and Daisy Johnson and [[Melinda May]] are acting as bridesmaids, with Davis and Peterson also present. Simmons turns around, wearing a wedding dress found by Shaw in a second-hand shop. Coulson begins to lead the wedding. Shaw, feeling awkward, starts asking Peterson occasional questions that come to mind.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS512"/>
*Simmons reads her vows, professing her love for him, and saying that she cannot wait for their next adventure: building a family. Fitz then says his vows, telling her how lucky he is to have her. They exchange rings, and Peterson tells Shaw he did well in picking them up from the pawn shop. Shaw explains that he chose Simmons' ring because it reminded him of one his [[Mrs. Shaw|mother]] used to wear, which he thinks might have belonged to his grandmother.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS512"/>
*[[Candice Lee]] returns to General [[Hale]] and tells her that she ran a genetic profile to see if Shaw's DNA matched anyone. She reveals that they not only found a match, but in fact found two: his DNA matches both Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS512"/>
*The newlywed couple kiss, and Peterson asks Shaw how he knows Fitz and Simmons, but Shaw explains that he does not know either particularly well. He does not realize that the reason the ring he bought looked like his grandmother's is because it was the very same ring, as Fitz and Simmons are in fact his grandparents and he just bought his grandmother the ring that he would then see his mother wear in the future.<ref name="AoS5 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="AoS512"/>

*<!--07:30-->[[Alex Wilder]] plays ''{{WPS|Star Wars Battlefront (2015 video game)|Star Wars Battlefront}}'' before going to school.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R102"/>
*[[File:RSW Battlefront.png|thumb|250px|[[Alex Wilder]] plays ''Star Wars Battlefront'' while his father talks to him]]Alex is approached by his dad, [[Geoffrey Wilder]], and tells him that the reason he has not played it in 2 years is that it is the game he and his friend, [[Amy Minoru]], had played together before she died. Geoffrey tries to comfort him, but Alex rejects the sympathy and goes to have breakfast with his mother, [[Catherine Wilder]]. They talk briefly about his attitude, and how his parents gave him space after Minoru died, but that it was time to stop being introverted. His father suggests that he meet up with his [[Runaways|old friends]], the other children of the members of [[PRIDE]], a small organization which the Wilder parents are also a part of. He tells Alex to value the friendships he has at this age, and not let them slip away.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement">In ''[[Reunion (Runaways)|Reunion]]'', it is shown that the last time Amy logged in to play ''Star Wars: Battlefront'' was "2 years ago". With ''PlayStation'' time stamps rounding down, this means it has been anywhere between 2.00 and 2.99 years. With the game released on November 16, 2015, this means that at the very earliest, it is now late November 2017. In ''[[Fifteen]]'', it is shown that in Geoffrey Wilder's drawer, he has what appears to be a newly bought 2018 planner. It does not look used, and is being kept in a drawer of miscellaneous items - the drawer being mainly intended for accessing his secret gun, not for important items. It can be taken, therefore, that it is roughly late 2017, but perhaps 2018. In ''[[Refraction]]'', in a flashback to "25 years ago", students are shown saying "Dude, have you seen ''Reservoir Dogs'' yet?" "Oh, my God, it was so good." The implication of this is that the film has just come out, which was in October 1992, suggesting that present day is late 2017. Chase also says in ''[[Rewind (Runaways)|Rewind]]'' that "in another year [he'll] be off to college", suggesting that it is late in the year, around the time college starts/a year before next year's college starts, and in ''Refraction'', they say that they will have "a hell of a personal essay for [their] college applications," implying that the applications are not yet finished, so it is not as late as January yet. In ''Rewind'', Frank looks at Leslie's laptop calendar, and it says that the date is Friday 8th. It also shows that the month before was 31 days long and that this month is also 31 days long. While this would make it August (which it cannot be, since August is not during school term) or January, after January 2016, which is far too early, the next time that all 3 criteria are satisfied is January 2021, which is far too late. The calendar is not a reliable source, however, as it shows that the month ends with "26, 27, 28, 29, 29, 30, 31" and the next month begins with "1, 2, 3, 4, 29". However, after July 2016, which is too early, the months that have Friday 8ths are September 2017, December 2017, June 2018, and February 2019. In ''[[Doomsday]]'', it is then shown that Atlas Academy is hosting the "non-holiday-specific seasonal dance", which implies it is December.
<br>Ultimately, it can be taken that ''[[Runaways (TV series)|Runaways]]'': Season 1 occurs in December 2017. This is 25 years since late 1992, 2 years and a few days since Amy last played ''Star Wars: Battlefront'' on her day of death in early December 2015 (a couple of weeks after the game was released), about the time when Geoffrey would have bought a 2018 planner but not have used it yet, just under a year until college, a bit before college application deadlines, a month where there is indeed a Friday 8th, the time when a "non-holiday-specific seasonal dance" would be held, and also the real time date at the middle of the season's run (from November 2017 to January 2018).
<br>''Runaways'': Season 1 therefore begins on Friday, December 8, 2017, with the events of ''[[Destiny]]'' on Saturday, December 9th, ''Fifteen'' beginning that night and then going to Monday, December 11th, when ''[[Kingdom]]'' also takes place. At the end of ''Kingdom'', Leslie says that the gala is in a few days, and ''[[Metamorphosis]]'' appears to be at the weekend, but when ''Metamorphosis'' picks up, characters act like it has been only a day or two, so it is as soon as possible after: Saturday, December 16th. ''Refraction'' and ''[[Tsunami]]'' are as soon as possible after again, and are confirmed by ''Doomsday'' to be on Thursday: Thursday, December 21st, with ''Doomsday'' the next day on Friday (the signs say "Friday 7-11 PM"), December 22nd, the last day of term, and finally ''[[Hostile]]'' taking the season to the morning of Sunday, December 24th. Victor says in ''Refraction'', "On Monday, you are gonna make a public apology to my son and reinstate him to the lacrosse team," implying that it should be the week before, as the Monday after December 18th is December 25th, when there is no school. This is overruled, however, by Jonah saying in ''Doomsday'', "[Your children have] been lying to you for weeks," and, "They've been conspiring against you for weeks," and Alex saying in the same episode, "Look, I know that it's been a shitty couple of weeks." This means it is at least 2 weeks after Friday 8th, so the earliest it can be is Friday 22nd rather than Friday 15th.</ref><ref name="R101"/>

[[Alex Wilder]] proposes that they investigate and suggests Stein should try to find out more about the [[Dematerialization Box|light box]]. Meanwhile, Wilder says that he will further investigate the secret room in the basement, as [[Nico Minoru]] states that she will study [[Tina Minoru|her mother]]'s [[Staff of One|magical staff]]. Hernandez mentions that there is a "[[Old Lace|monster]]" in the basement that she discovered the night before, and that they should investigate it, but the others do not believe her. As they leave to investigate, [[Karolina Dean]] approaches Stein to ask about what happened at the party, but he assures her there is nothing to worry about.<ref name="R103 Placement"/><ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R103"/>

*[[Catherine Wilder|Catherine]] and [[Geoffrey Wilder]] discuss the possibility that [[Molly Hernandez]] might have seen something of their ritual the night before, and Catherine suggests using the Synnergy Serum on Hernandez as a precaution, because if she has seen something, it will make her forget. Geoffrey opposes this idea, pointing out how [[Frank Dean]], Karolina's father, ended up confused and unintelligent after they used it on him. They conclude to talk to Hernandez first and ascertain whether she knows anything.<ref name="R103 Placement"/><ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R103"/>

*[[Molly Hernandez]] wakes in [[Catherine Wilder]]'s car and Wilder questions her further. Knowing that Wilder is aware she is lying, Hernandez improvises by pretending to reveal the truth: that yes, she lied, but because the truth was that she was in the studio looking for alcohol for the others. Wilder believes her, and Hernandez begins to enquire in return about her deceased parents.

Dean also tries to subtly ask whether Kaye has had anything strange happen to him after removing his bracelet, but he says he has not, making Dean wonder further about the colors she had seen.

Some of the group begin to think that their parents might be murderers, while the others feel that they want to wait before judging, hoping for another explanation. [[Chase Stein]] suggests that they protect themselves, just in case, before ending the video call.<ref name="R104 Opening Placement">In the opening of ''[[Fifteen]]'', the group call Nico Minoru to tell her the news about Destiny Gonzalez, and Gert Yorkes asks, "Have you been under a rock all night?"

There is, therefore, a jump of a day-and-a-half between Alex Wilder finding his father's gun and Victor Stein driving a kidnapped girl to be the next sacrifice.</ref><ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R104"/>
*[[Alex Wilder]] goes to check his father's office. He finds that the coaster mechanism to open the secret passage no longer works, so he starts to search his father's desk.

*Having kidnapped a young woman to use as the new sacrifice, [[Victor Stein]] drives her to the other members of [[PRIDE]], gagged in the back of a van.<ref name="R104 Main Events Placement">In ''[[Fifteen]]'', after Alex Wilder finds his father's gun on the evening of Saturday, December 9, 2017, there is a jump of roughly a day-and-a-half to Monday, December 11, 2017. This is evident because the events of the rest of the episode take place on a school day, so it cannot simply be the next day, despite that being the implication. It has to be at least Monday. This is supported by the fact that when Chase Stein encounters his lacrosse teammates for the first time since the party, they say, "All weekend, no apology?" This heavily suggests it is Monday, with it being their first encounter since Friday and it being just after "all weekend". Frank Dean also says to Leslie, "I haven't seen you in days." The last time he saw her was Friday, so this works well as Monday, 3 days later, and matches with what Leslie says, "That's what I've been doing in there, praying for you over the last 2 days." She is claiming to have been praying since Saturday.</ref><ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R104"/>

*[[Nico Minoru]] meets with [[Alex Wilder]] before class. She tells him that she is sure that her sister, Amy, cannot have committed suicide, because her diary has shown how happy she was. Minoru proposes going to the police, but Wilder is not sure that this is the best option, at least for the moment.

*Victor Stein speaks with the other members of PRIDE. He believes that the headaches he is experiencing are side-effects of medicine for malaria, and continues to believe that he is at fault for the failure of the [[Dematerialization Box]]. [[Geoffrey Wilder]], meanwhile, decides that his people will catch the girl, but [[Leslie Dean]] arrives and says that "[[Jonah|he]]" is very sick and they need a new sacrifice urgently, even if it is a homeless person or a prostitute. [[Robert Minoru]] and Stein are chosen to find the new sacrifice.

*[[Eiffel]] approaches Karolina Dean, blaming her for the fighting between the boys and shaming her for what happened to her.

When they come across [[Alex Wilder]], they tell him about this theory and ask him to join them to go to [[Dean Mansion|Dean's house]] and try to gather more information.

Arriving at the [[Stein Mansion|Steins' mansion]], she tells him that she wants to show him something.

*While they wait to be dealt witch, Minoru notices that [[Victor Stein]], [[Robert Minoru|her father]], and a [[Flores (LAPD)|detective]] are also in the station. She takes Wilder to quickly flee the station and, once outside, she explains to him that the detective with Stein and Robert is the same one she saw come to the house when [[Amy Minoru|her sister]] had died 2 years ago. Wilder believes that their parents might also control the police, realizing that it is not safe to report anything to them.

However, the bracelet coming off allows Dean to use her powers, which activate, causing her to shine with colors again and suddenly start levitating, saving her life.

Caine reveals that his job was like the post-[[World War II]] {{WPS|Operation Paperclip}}, but for the [[Cybertek]] workers, allocating them to work in places their expertise can be put to good use while faking their deaths and giving them new identities.

She ignores this and starts to tell him how happy she is that he has found friends, but begins to speak harshly, saying that he knows if he gets close to someone they will most likely be killed. She is then suddenly impaled with an axe by an apparent Kree Warrior, all in fact being the [[Fear Dimension]]'s manifestation of Shaw's thoughts about his mother's murder. The warrior attacks him, but he manages to stab it and the manifestation dissolves into smoke.

He tells Nico how they had realized that Amy's hacker was, in fact, [[Tina Minoru|Tina]], and Nico assumes that Amy could not face her mother after this, but still cannot see how this led to her suicide. She angrily compares Wilder to her mother for the way they have both lied repeatedly. Wilder is apologetic, saying he should have done better but could not pass on the information as he had made a promise to Amy to keep it secret, and that whenever he had tried to reach out, she had been too reclusive. Nico finds this an insufficient excuse, and Wilder admits he was also afraid that if he told her, she would never speak to him again, saying he would do anything not to lose her as well as Amy. As they speak, Nico comes to a realization that there must be a further detail they have not worked out, as this does not explain why Tina closed the house and prevented her from calling emergency services. Wilder suggests that Amy may have wanted to run away from home, reminding Nico that her cell phone and backpack were in her room the night of her death.

*[[Chase Stein]] asks his mother what will happen if his father lives or dies.

*Dale and Stacey Yorkes insist to the rest of PRIDE that they are not properly qualified doctors, but agree to try to help Victor, and begin by sewing his artery to prevent further bleeding.

*[[PRIDE]] meets with [[Leslie Dean]] and [[Jonah]] at the dig site, which is owned by [[Geoffrey Wilder]]. Jonah reveals that he has fired Wilder's men, however, to hire more dedicated workers. [[Tina Minoru]] and [[Dale Yorkes]] ask Jonah for information about the supposed source of renewable energy they are digging for, but he avoids answering. Jonah then finally turns on the drill.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R109"/>
*Meanwhile, [[Darius Davis]] meets with one of Wilder's workers leaving the site - a mole he is paying for information. The guard informs him that he has been fired, and Davis notices the drill starting. He expresses his intrigue in finally finding out what the dig is for.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R109"/>
*[[Molly Hernandez]] finds her friends at Atlas Academy and reunites with them, showing them the VHS tape she has acquired. Together, the group go to the AV club meeting room, where an old video player is housed which will allow them to view it together. The video begins and the group watch as [[Alice Hernandez|Alice]] and [[Gene Hernandez]] are shown, talking to the camera. They talk about [[PRIDE]] and the drilling that is supposedly in search of a supposed renewable energy, but that they are now doubting this was the truth. They also warn that even if the drilling has good intent, there is a blind fault underground, which, if disturbed, will cause massive earthquakes and fires. In addition, they mention that they have found weird things in their rock samples, and that if Molly is watching the video, it means they have not been able to stop PRIDE's work. The video finishes, and the group discuss its content, and the implications this suggests their parents' actions will have. [[Alex Wilder]] tells them that they have to stop their parents, saying that they could use the school dance as a cover from their parents for why they are leaving their homes, as they in fact go to sabotage the machine at the dig site.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R109"/>
*[[Frank Dean]] meets Jonah, telling him he has important information to relay. Jonah listens attentively as Dean passes on what Karolina had told him.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R109"/>
*Before leaving for the school dance, [[Janet Stein]] asks Chase if he will be going with Karolina, but he tells her that he is growing to think she is interested in him. He quotes [[Gert Yorkes]], telling his mother that taking is "heteronormative" anyway, which makes her laugh. He explains that while he often does not understand Yorkes, she does make some good points.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R109"/>
*[[Nico Minoru]] calls [[Alex Wilder]] and tells him to come to her house. Wilder meets with her, and she talks to him about the warning message she found on Amy's cell phone. They conclude that it definitely seems like someone killed Amy, and she did not commit suicide, realizing that it cannot have been Tina, as the message said "he", and neither Robert nor [[Kincaid]] can have sent the message as it is from an unknown number not in Amy's contacts. Robert interrupts them and asks for a photograph of the two before the dance. Wilder compliments Nico, but she says she no longer cares what he thinks.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R109">''[[Doomsday|Runaways: 1.09: Doomsday]]''</ref>
*The Yorkeses call [[Graciela Aguirre]] to check in on [[Molly Hernandez]], only to be informed that she has run away. Aguirre tells them that Hernandez's biological parents did not trust them as they did not leave them Molly's key, and that she does not trust them either. The Yorkes parents notice Aguirre's mention of a key and realize that Hernandez's parents must have known they could be in danger, having left Molly a key in case they failed. Before they can try to contact Molly, they receive a call from Jonah, who tells them to attend an urgent [[PRIDE]] meeting.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R109"/>
*[[Gert Yorkes]] drives her and Hernandez to the ball, and park near the dance hall. Hernandez notices that Yorkes has dressed up for the occasion, and teases her about fancying Chase Stein, telling her to go get him. She stays hidden in the car with Yorkes' Deinonychus, while the other friends enter the hall to attend the dance as their cover.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R109"/>
*Yorkes meets with [[Chase Stein]] and she tells him that she has always felt ignored, and that she never actually thought he was an idiot as she had said in the past, as it was a defense mechanism. He tells her that he is glad to have moved on from his old life, because his current friendships are more honest and real, and they decide to dance together to enjoy what might be their last night alive. They retire to a private room and become intimate, beginning to kiss and then taking off their clothes, deciding to have sex.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R109"/>
*Wondering where Yorkes and Stein are, [[Nico Minoru]] leaves to find them, pointedly taking [[Karolina Dean]] for company rather than Wilder to further express her annoyance with him. The pair cannot find them and decide to head back, but before they do, Dean decides to give into her feelings for Minoru and make an advance on her. She moves to kiss Minoru, and Minoru reciprocates. Yorkes and Stein then appear, still putting on their clothes, and both couples come to realize the others' feelings and newfound relationships.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R109"/>
*Jonah tells [[PRIDE]] how displeased he is with them all, and informs them that their [[Runaways|children]] have been lying to them and conspiring against them for weeks. Leslie Dean asks him how he knows, and Jonah tells them that one of them revealed it to him. He begins to list the betrayals each parent has made against him and how they have questioned his leadership, and warns them not to continue, or that there will be dire consequences, then asks them again to check where their children are.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R109"/>
*The parents return to their homes and find that their children have stolen certain things: the [[Staff of One]] is missing from the Minorus' the [[Old Lace|dinosaur]] is missing from the Yorkeses', the [[Fistigons]] are missing from the Steins', which Janet Stein alerts Leslie Dean about, and the key card to the [[PRIDE Construction Site]] is missing from [[Geoffrey Wilder]]'s office. Geoffrey informs Catherine, surmising that the group will be breaking into the dig site.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R109"/>
*[[Darius Davis]] meets with his pregnant wife, [[Tamar]], and tells her about the strange things he saw when he came up against Alex Wilder and his friends.

*'''[[Infiltration into the PRIDE Construction Site]]''':
**The [[Runaways|group]] arrive at the construction site, leaving Yorkes' Deinonychus in the car. They go to enter the site but are stopped by a guard from the [[Church of Gibborim]] called [[Carl (Gibborim)|Carl]]. Karolina Dean claims that they have permission from her father to enter, using the excuse of a school photography project. He says he wants to check with Frank, but Karolina is hopeful that Frank will let them through, as he is the one parent she believes is on their side. Frank answers the phone and tells Carl that it is fine to let them through, but does so not to help Karolina, but because Jonah, sitting quietly next to him, tells him to do so.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R109"/>
**Darius Davis, sitting in a car nearby the site to spy on Geoffrey Wilder, sees the group entering the restricted area. He gets out of his car to follow them.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R109"/>
**Upon entering, the friends are shocked by the depth of the drilled hole, but proceed with their plan to destroy the site. Chase Stein and [[Gert Yorkes]] go to take over the drill's controls, and end up discussing what happened at the dance. Yorkes is nervous and insists it must have been a one-off, which confuses Stein, not understanding her conflicting feelings on the matter. However, he insists that the matter at hand is more important, and that he needs to focus. Meanwhile, [[Molly Hernandez]] uses her super strength to push a site truck into the hole.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R109"/>
**Stein realizes that he can cut out the power to the drill by force and uses his [[Fistigons]] to blast them, successfully rendering the machine out of order. Hernandez successfully drops the truck into the hole, and Minoru proceeds to request that the [[Staff of One]] "fill the hole", causing dirt from nearby to fly through the air and descend into the chasm. However, their attempt to stop the drill completely is thwarted as their parents suddenly arrive, and [[Tina Minoru]] uses her control of the staff to summon it away from her daughter and into her hands.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R109"/>
**The teenagers ask their parents how they could have chosen to murder so many young people, and [[PRIDE]] promise that their actions were done to help their children, but the group refuse to accept this, saying they are ready to oppose PRIDE and even fight them if they have to. Karolina Dean takes off her bracelet in preparation for a potential altercation and begins to shine. Leslie is shocked and tells the other parents that she was not aware her daughter was capable of this, but had feared it might be the case.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R109"/>
**Yorkes' [[Old Lace|Deinonychus]] arrives to help the group, having sensed Yorkes' fear, but [[Dale Yorkes]] shoots her with a tranquilizer dart. Yorkes runs to help her. [[Chase Stein]] starts to fight back, firing the Fistigons at the parents, with Karolina Dean shooting rays of luminescent energy at them as well, but both attempts are stopped by [[Tina Minoru]], using the [[Staff of One]] to protect PRIDE.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R110"/>
**[[Molly Hernandez]], wanting to help, goes to lift a barrel, but she is knocked out by a luminescent beam fired by [[Jonah]], who arrives and joins the parents, preparing to fight the teenagers himself.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R110"/>
**As Darius Davis watches on, Tina Minoru tries to defend the children from Jonah, but he uses a beam to blast the staff out of her hand. PRIDE desperately ask Jonah not to hurt their children with both entreaties and threats, but he blasts the children with rays nonetheless, knocking them on the ground.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R110"/>
**The [[Runaways|teenagers]] get back up, as Yorkes meanwhile takes the tranquilizer dart out of her dinosaur and then goes to rejoin her friends. Together with the Deinonychus, all of them stand together and prepare to fight Jonah, but Karolina Dean asks the others to flee, saying she knows that Jonah is there specifically for her. The group are reluctant to leave, but she insists and they eventually follow her suggestion, getting to safety as Jonah and Dean both begin to shine with luminescent energy.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R110"/>
**Jonah and Dean both build energy individually and fire at each other, with the beams of their attacks meeting in between them and coalescing into a growing ball. The ball eventually explodes and causes an electromagnetic pulse, frying all electrical devices in the vicinity.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R110"/>
*The group realize that the car, Fistigons, and all other devices will no longer work. [[Nico Minoru]] wants to return to rescue Dean, but Wilder asks her to be intelligent because they have no way to fight. Nonetheless, she goes to look through the fence to see if she can find her, but sees that neither Jonah nor Dean are still present, but [[PRIDE]] are, and are starting to look for their children. Minoru returns to her friends and warns them about their parents searching for them, and the group run away.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R110"/>

====23rd====
*The next morning, the [[Runaways|teenagers]] look for a place to go, with Yorkes' [[Old Lace|Deinonychus]] hidden with a blanket in a shopping cart. A police car passes and Wilder asserts that they have to get off the streets, leading them up to the woods by the [[Griffith Observatory]].<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R110"/>
*Reaching the woods and a clearing where they can stay, the group begin to discuss what to do next. The group consider escaping, except [[Nico Minoru]], who wants to save Karolina Dean. She points out the sacrifice Dean made for them, and [[Molly Hernandez]] supports her, eventually convincing the group that they have to try to rescue their friend.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R110"/>
*The Minoru parents, Yorkes parents, Wilder parents, and [[Janet Stein]] all meet to talk, and discuss how how upset they are by the revelation of an inner circle and secrets within [[PRIDE]]. They agree that Karolina Dean must be Jonah's daughter and the Yorkeses speculate that Hernandez must have acquired her strength powers somehow from the explosion of her parents' laboratory. [[Geoffrey Wilder]] orders [[Tina Minoru]] to reveal what she knows about the explosion, having always suspected her to have been involved due to her burnt hand at the Hernandezes funeral. She confesses that she knows [[Leslie Dean]] was involved in causing the explosion, but says that she herself had done nothing, though had allowed it to happen. Everyone begins to wonder what the excavation is for, so the Yorkeses suggest going to the site to look into it further. [[Catherine Wilder]], meanwhile, suggests asking Karolina Dean to find out what their children know.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R110"/>
*In the meditation room at the [[Church of Gibborim Executive Office]], Leslie and [[Frank Dean]] discuss how they have mutually betrayed each other, while Karolina is resting, recovering in the bed. [[Jonah]] soon enters the room and requests that the two of them leave, so he can take care of his daughter.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R110"/>
*Nico Minoru, [[Chase Stein]], and Molly Hernandez buy new clothes and a wig for [[Gert Yorkes]], hoping it will help them go unnoticed. Minoru and Stein discuss discovering each other's new relationships the night before, and Stein admits that he really likes Yorkes.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R110"/>
*[[Alex Wilder]] meets Yorkes on the hill by Griffith Observatory after an unsuccessful visit to the city trying to find a computer he can use. He gives Yorkes a flyer about old movies showing nearby that he found. The other three return to the hill from buying food, and the group reluctantly decides that they will have to leave the Deinonychus behind. Yorkes insists that she needs to come, but the rest of the group agree that it is not safe to bring her, as it would make them easier to get caught and potentially lead to her getting caught as well.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R110"/>
*Yorkes has a private moment with the dinosaur to say goodbye. She talks to her about their connection, remembering the name of a film from the flyer, she says that their partnership is as if the dinosaur were the "Old Lace" to her "Arsenic" - deciding that she will name her "[[Old Lace]]".<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R110"/>
*In a cafeteria, the group corners a young man from the [[Church of Gibborim]], [[Vaughn Kaye]]. They ask him to help finding [[Karolina Dean]], having assumed that she will be in the Church Executive Office. They tell him about the Church's involvement with killing one runaway every year, but he does not believe their claim and leaves.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R110"/>
*[[Jonah]] removes Karolina Dean's breathing mask, awakening her. She starts asking for her friends and father, but he reveals to her that while Frank raised her, he is in fact her biological father, and that he no longer feels alone. He offers to guide her and help her not feel lonely anymore either.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R110"/>

*The Yorkeses prepare to use seismic refraction and echo-sounding at the excavation, in order to find what Jonah is really digging for. However, they are interrupted by [[Leslie Dean]]. The couple make poor excuses on the spot, but Dean tells them to be honest about what they are doing. The Yorkeses' computer then tells them that there is something alive under the excavation, confusing the couple, and Dean, hearing this, reveals that even she did not know about it.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R110"/>
*Kaye informs Leslie Dean of his encounter with the teenagers, and to his surprise, she tells him that he should assist them.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R110">''[[Hostile|Runaways: 1.10: Hostile]]''</ref>
*Stein and Hernandez are both filling out forms to join the Gibborim runaway project when they are approached by Vaughn Kaye. He takes them to start looking for Karolina Dean, claiming to Aura and Frances that Stein and Hernandez are "special" and that Leslie will want to meet them, so as to get past the duo.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R110"/>
*Meanwhile, [[Alex Wilder]] decides to look for a vehicle while [[Gert Yorkes]] confesses to [[Nico Minoru]] that she is struggling with her anxiety, without her medication to help her. Yorkes talks about Stein and claims that there is no relationship between them and that it was a one-off, but Minoru helps her understand that Stein actually loves her and is interested in taking their relationship further.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R110"/>
*The Wilder parents approach [[Jonah]], asking to speak with Karolina Dean. He tells them that she must recover first and that they cannot demand anything, and asks them to trust him. They reluctantly leave, claiming that they will not work for Jonah anymore and that they must find Alex before he does. Unbeknown to them, Alex is hiding behind a nearby van and hears their conversation.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R110"/>
*'''[[Rescue of Karolina Dean]]''': Stein, Hernandez, and Kaye arrive at the private meditation room. Hernandez then uses her powers to smash the door, and Kaye decides to leave and not be further involved. Stein and Hernandez reunite with Dean and begin to descend the stairs to make their escape. They are stopped by [[Aura]] and [[Frances]], and Dean claims that she is simply giving two of her friends a tour, but the Gibborim women recognize her to be lying and call security. The trio run to escape and make it outside, where they find that Alex Wilder has broken into a Gibborim van and found the keys above the mirror. They jump into the van and Wilder drives them away.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R110"/>
*[[Vaughn Kaye]] informs [[Leslie Dean]] that Karolina has escaped with her friends, as she had wanted. Kaye then asks Leslie if it is true that Jonah is taking charge of the church, but Leslie assures him that this is not the case.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R110"/>
*Meanwhile, Jonah receives a text message saying, "Mission accomplished. Let me know what's next."<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R110"/>
*In the forest outside of Griffith Observatory, the [[Runaways|group]] begin to make a bonfire. Wilder talks to Minoru about whether she ever thinks about calling her parents, but she says she would have nothing to say. She then walks away and finds [[Karolina Dean]]. They share a private moment, and Dean thanks her for having the group rescue her despite it being a risky decision. The two share a second kiss, affirming for each other that they have feelings. They then realize that Wilder has disappeared, and Minoru worries that he might be calling his parents.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R110"/>
*[[Alex Wilder]] makes a call from the city, but not to his parents, instead to [[Darius Davis]], believing he can help them.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R110"/>
*The Yorkes parents wonder how the living beings from the dig site could survive underground. [[Stacey Yorkes]] assumes that if they study Jonah's serum, they might be able to learn about how his biology works, and this leads the couple to realize than in doing so, they could potentially learn how to kill him, as well as the life at the bottom of the excavation. They are interrupted when [[Leslie Dean]], the Minorus, and [[Janet Stein]] ring the doorbell.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R110"/>
*Darius Davis meets with Alex Wilder after receiving his call, and asks for him to explain everything that has happened recently. Wilder says he needs something in return, and the two agree to make an alliance as they share a common enemy in Geoffrey Wilder. Davis gives him a gun and a stack of money.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R110"/>
*At the [[Yorkes Residence|Yorkes' home]], Leslie Dean suggests that the group work together to kill [[Jonah]], after he manipulated them for all over 15 years. She decides to confess to the others; however, the remaining secrets she has: that she was involved in not only the [[Assassination of Gene and Alice Hernandez|Hernandezes' deaths]], but also [[Amy Minoru]]'s. Dean explains how Amy had set off an alarm when she hacked [[Wizard]], and that Jonah had been alerted and decided to deal with Amy in case she found any [[PRIDE]] secrets. She tells them how she had not believed Jonah when he said he was only going to talk to Amy and had texted the teenager to warn her, but was too late. Tina is furious at Dean for knowing the truth for 2 years and never telling them, and for having them continue to help Jonah despite him having killed her daughter. She threatens to kill Dean, but Dean reminds her that they need her alive if she is going to help them kill Jonah.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R110"/>
*Jonah meets with [[Frank Dean]], assuring him that they will have a bright future working together, and that when [[Victor Stein]] recovers, they will be able to take exciting new steps in his plans. However, Jonah secretly notices that the skin on his arm is flaking again, and realizes that despite [[Andre Compton]]'s sacrifice, he will soon need to take another person's life to fuel his own.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R110"/>

====24th====
*Soon after dawn, [[Alex Wilder]] returns to the group's camp, and [[Nico Minoru]] asks where he was. He assures her that he did not call his parents and shows her the money he has acquired, but decides not to reveal who he got it from. Minoru is pleased to see the money, but concerned by Wilder's secrecy.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R110"/>
*[[Geoffrey Wilder]] tells [[Catherine Wilder|Catherine]] that he is about to make a call that will change everything. He hopes that his actions will get their son to safety, so that then they can focus on taking down Jonah.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R110"/>

*The teenagers enter a bus depot, hoping to flee from [[Los Angeles]] using Wilder's newly acquired money. [[Gert Yorkes]], meanwhile, decides to wait outside to be on lookout, but while she waits, she hears a commotion from inside a trash container. She opens the lid and is delighted to discover that [[Old Lace]] has been following them.<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R110"/>
[[File:Hostile pic.png|thumb|250px|The [[Runaways]] are forced to flee]]
*Yorkes runs inside to give her friends the good news, but at that moment, it is [[WHiH World News|announced on television]] that [[Molly Hernandez]] has been declared missing, and that Nico Minoru, [[Karolina Dean]], [[Chase Stein]], Gert Yorkes, and Alex Wilder are believed to have kidnapped her, as well as now being prime suspects in the death of [[Destiny Gonzalez]], which is now believed to have been a homicide. The group are horrified at the further lies their parents have told and the framing of Gonzalez's death on them. As images of their faces are shown on the screen, a man in the depot recognizes them. The group realize they have to leave, and Old Lace runs to join them as the group, united as the [[Runaways]], sprint to get away. As they run, they pass over a ''[[California (newspaper)|California]]'' newspaper bearing the headline, "Earthquake Watch: Is L.A. Next?".<ref name="R1 December 2017 Placement"/><ref name="R110"/>

====25th====
*24 hours after the teenagers ran away, [[Los Angeles Police Department]] believe themselves to have found the group.<ref name="R2 December 2017-January 2018 Placement">''[[Runaways (TV series)|Runaways]]'': [[Runaways (TV series)/Season Two|Season 2]] begins with a scene set a little over "24 hours" after the end of Season 1, which was December 24, 2017 (see other references), making it December 25, 2017. The show then proceeds the following day, December 26, 2017. However, there is an undefined gap between Alex Wilder returning to the group with sleeping bags and burner phones and the group being woken by Mike on a Bike one morning soon after. While the group are in the same clothes, they do not have changes of clothes yet while they are on the run.<br>The season continues from there, with the main events of Episode 4 - ''[[Old School]]'' 3 days later said to be a "Thursday", and it is during the school term, making it at least Thursday, January 11, 2018 and thus the Mike on a Bike scene at least Monday, January 8, 2018, so minimum 13 days passing between Wilder returning to the group and Mike on a Bike turning up. this is a stretch, with it implied that the Mike on a Bike scene is very shortly after Wilder returning, but is just about possible. However, a further week - if ''Old School'' needed to be Thursday, January 18th instead, would be highly implausible, and any more weeks would be near-impossible.<br>In Episode 5 - ''[[Rock Bottom]]'', the following day, Chase Stein and Wilder joke about their time since running away, and refer to "one Thursday in there". This suggests at least three Thursdays since their running away, which supports it being at least Friday, January 12, 2018 - and again, likely not much later.<br>2 days later, in Episode 7 - ''[[Last Rites]]'', Nico Minoru says that life was normal "2 months ago", making it currently between 1 and 2 months since December 8, 2017 (see other references), again supporting at least a 13-day span in that undefined break in ''[[Gimmie Shelter]]'' and making it at least Sunday, January 14, 2018, and definitely no later than Sunday, February 4, 2018 (which would involve a 34-day span in the ''Gimmie Shelter'' gap, nearly impossible).<br>In ''Gimmie Shelter'', Darius Davis says on December 26, 2017 that his son is due in "2 weeks". His wife Tamar leaves hospital with his son in ''[[Past Life (Runaways)|Past Life]]'', approximately 9 days after the Mike on a Bike scene. Therefore, with that being no earlier than Monday, January 8, 2018 as established, this should be no earlier than roughly Wednesday, January 16, 2018, 3 weeks after Davis' comment. This is acceptable if you assume Davis was rounding down from a little over 2 weeks, and Tamar had to stay for a couple of days, but any later would not work. This confirms that the Mike on a Bike scene should be no later than Monday, January 8, 2018, as well as no earlier, which was confirmed above.<br>In ''[[Hostile Takeover]]'', it is said to be "Wednesday". However, it seems to only be about 8 days since Gert Yorkes stated in ''Old School'' that it was "Thursday". So, to make this work, 5 extra off-screen days need to pass in the time between ''Old School'' and ''Hostile Takeover'', so have been added where possible, taking ''Hostile Takeover'' to Wednesday, January 24, 2018. The events of Season 2 following the Mike on a Bike scene in ''Gimmie Shelter'' therefore take place January 8-28, 2018.<br>Scenes in ''Gimmie Shelter'' between Wilder returning to the group and Mike on a Bike are placed in the most appropriate dates between December 26, 2017 and January 8, 2018.<br>In ''Past Life'', Alex Wilder's phone says "10/07/2018 01:54am", but it is daytime so it is clearly incorrect anyway, and the date does not match with it being mere weeks since December 2017, as well as confirmation from Jeph Loeb that it is set before ''Avengers: Infinity War'' ([https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/8pbxyk/im_jeph_loeb_head_of_marvel_tv_ama/e0a5ju5/ 1], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UqrlizXWIM&t=2015s 2]), so before May 2018. The song ''Bubblin'' by Anderson .Paak is also played in-universe in ''Past Life'', suggesting it is at least May 2018, after the song's release, but this must also be taken as simply an error. Finally, Leslie Dean is shown to be a few months pregnant in the season. While this would imply a few months at least since Jonah was healed by Andre Compton's sacrifice, this is impossible, so it must be taken that either the baby was conceived at a time before Jonah had fallen into a fully scaled state, or the gestation period is faster due to being half-alien.</ref><ref name="R201"/>
